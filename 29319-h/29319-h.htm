<h2>THE TRIMMING OF GOOSIE</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap">"Why, Goosie, what are you doing?"</p>

<p>Goosie, otherwise Mr. Charles-Norton
Sims, dropped his arms hastily
down his sides and stood very still, caged in the
narrow space between porcelain tub and gleaming
towel-rack. The mirror before which he had
been performing his morning calisthenics faced
him uncompromisingly; it showed him that he
was blushing. The sight increased his embarrassment.
For a moment panic went bounding
and rebounding swiftly in painted contagion
from Goosie to the mirror, from the mirror to
Goosie; the blush, at first faint on Charles-Norton's
brow, flamed, spread over his face, down
his neck, fell in cascade along his broad shoulders,
and then rippled down his satiny skin clear
to the barrier of the swimming trunks tight
about his waist. It was some time before he
mustered the courage to turn his foolish face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
toward the door through which had sounded the
cooing cry of his little wife.</p>

<p>The door was but a few inches a-jar; it let
pass only the round little nose of the round little
wife, between two wide-open blue-flowers of eyes.
"What are you doing, Goosie?" she repeated in
a tone slightly amused but rich with a large tolerance;
"what are you doing, Goosie, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Dolly," he answered, his straight,
athletic body a bit gawky with embarrassment;
"nothing."</p>

<p>Then, as she peered, still doubtful, through
the crack: "It's a new exercise I have&mdash;a dandy.
See?"</p>

<p>And lamely he placed both his hands beneath
his armpits and waved his elbows up and down
three times.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, as if satisfied.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, this was not the accurate
repetition of what she had seen. He had
been standing before the mirror very straight,
then, a-tip-toe, his chest bulging; his arms, bent
with hands beneath the shoulders, had been beating
up and down with a rapidity that made of
them a mere white vibration, their tattoo upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
his ribs like the beating of a drum; and suddenly,
as if to some singular ecstasy, his head had gone
back and out of his rounded mouth there had
clarioned a clear cock-a-doo-del-doo-oo, much like
that of chanticleer heralding the sun.</p>

<p>"It's fine&mdash;it's fine for the pectoral muscles,"
he went on, more firmly.</p>

<p>"Well," she said charitably, "jump into your
bath, quick, dear. Breakfast is ready, and you'll
be late at the office again if you don't hurry."
She closed the door softly upon him.</p>

<p>It was seldom that she intruded thus upon the
mystery of his morning hygienics. It was with
a clothed Charles-Norton that she had first fallen
in love; and like most women (who, being
practical, realize that, since it is dressed, after
all, that men go through the world, it is dressed
that they must be judged) Dolly appreciated
her handsome young husband best in his broad-shouldered
sack-coat and well-creased trousers.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, still rather abashed, dropped
into the cold green tub, splashed, rubbed down,
dressed, and sat down to breakfast. As he ate
his waffles, though, out of the blue breakfast set
which Dolly's charming, puzzle-browed economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
had managed to extort from the recalcitrant
family budget, his usual glowing loquacity of
after-the-bath was lacking. His eyes wandered
furtively about the little encumbered
room; thoughts, visibly, rolled within his head
which did not find his lips. And when he bade
Dolly good-by, on the fifth-story landing, she
missed in his kiss the usual warm linger.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">When Charles-Norton reached the street,
a narrow side-street in which like a
glacier the ice of the whole winter was
still heaped, a whiff of soft air, perfumed with
a suspicion of spring, struck him gently in the
face. He drew it in deep within his lungs, and
exhaled it in a long sigh. And then he stopped
abruptly, and was standing very still, listening;
listening to this sigh, to the echo of it still within
his consciousness, as if testing it. He shook his
head disapprovingly. "Gee," he said; "hope I'm
not getting discontented again!"</p>

<p>As if in response, another gentle gust came
down the street; he caught it as it came and drew
it deep within him. His chest swelled, his eyes
brightened. And then suddenly he tensed; he
rose a-tip-toe, heels close together, his head went
back; his hands stole to his armpits, and his elbows
began to wave up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good Lord!" he ejaculated, catching himself
up sharply; "here goes that darned flapping
again!"</p>

<p>He looked up and down the street, assuming a
negligent attitude. His forehead was red.
"Nope," he said. No one had seen him. "<i>She</i>
saw me this morning," he thought, and the red
of his forehead came down to his cheeks. "It's
getting worse; a regular habit. Let me see&mdash;two,
three; it began three weeks ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head perplexedly and resumed his
way toward the Elevated station.</p>

<p>"It may have been all right when I was a
boy," he said to himself as he swung along.
"But now!</p>

<p>"Let me see. I was fourteen, the first time."</p>

<p>A picture rose before his eyes. It had happened
in a far western land&mdash;a land that now
remained in his memory as a pool of gold beneath
a turquoise sky. He was lying there in
the wild oats, upon his back, and above him in
the sky a hawk circled free. He watched it long
thus, relaxed in a sort of droning somnolence;
then suddenly, to a particularly fine spiral of
the bird in the air, something like a convulsion
had shot through his body, and he had found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
himself erect, head back and chest forward, his
arms flapping&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Twas the day before I ran away with the
circus," he soliloquized in the midst of the throng
milling up the Elevated station stairs. "And
later, when I had come back from the circus, I
took that long bum on brake-beams. And when
I had come back from that, a little later I went
off in the forecastle of the 'Tropic Bird' to
Tahiti. And each time that flapping business
came first. Every time I've done something wild
and foolish, I've flapped first like this. First I'd
flap, then I'd feel like doing something, I
wouldn't know what, then I'd do it&mdash;and it would
be something foolish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The train slid up to the platform; he boarded
it and by some miracle found on the bench behind
the door of the last car a narrow space in
which he squeezed himself.</p>

<p>"I'll have to stop it," he said decisively.</p>

<p>He drew from his breast pocket a note-book
and a pencil. Opening the book out across
his knees, he bent over it and began to draw. He
worked with concentration, but seemingly with
little result, for he drew only detached lines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
There were spirals, circles, ovals, parabolas;
lines that curved upward, broke, and curved
again downward, like gothic arches; lines that
curved in gentle languor; lines that breathed
like the undulations of a peaceful sea; and then
just zipping, swift, straight lines that shot up to
the upper end of the paper and seemed to continue
invisibly toward an altitudinous nowhere.
This is all he drew, and yet as he worked there
was in his face the set of stubborn purpose,
and in his eyes the glow of aspiration. He tried
to make each line beautiful and firm and swift
and pure. When he succeeded, he felt within
him the bubbling of a sweet contentment. This
would be followed by dissatisfaction, renewed
yearning&mdash;and he would begin again.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he muttered in sudden consternation,
straightening away from the book.</p>

<p>And then, "They began at the same time."</p>

<p>And a moment later, "And they are the
same."</p>

<p>It had struck him abruptly that the strange
urge which made him draw lines was like that
which at times convulsed his body into that mysterious
manifestation which, for the want of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
better word, he called his "flapping." The two
things had begun together, and they were of the
same essence. The impulse which possessed him
as he tried for beauty with paper and pencil was
the same which swelled his lungs and his heart,
which made him rise a-tip-toe and wave his arms.
It came from a feeling of subtle and inexplicable
dissatisfaction; it was made of a vague and vast
longing. It was the same which, when a boy, had
sent him to the brake-beam, the circus, and the
sea; it was to be distrusted.</p>

<p>He slammed the book shut and put it in his
pocket. "No more of this," he said.</p>

<p>A certain confidence, though, came gradually
into his eyes. "After all, these things do not
mean much now," he thought. "I was a boy,
then, and unhappy. I am a man, now, and
happy."</p>

<p>His mind idled back over the two years since
his marriage, over the warm coziness of the last
two years. What a wife, this little Dolly! What
a little swaddler! She wrapped up everything
as in cotton&mdash;all the asperities of Life, and the
asperities of Charles-Norton himself also. Gone
for the two years had been the old uncertainties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the vague tumults, the blind surges. Yes, he was
happy.</p>

<p>This word happy, for the second time on his
tongue, set him a-dreaming. A picture came
floating before his eyes. And curiously enough,
it was not of Dolly, nor of the padded little
flat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was of a boy, a boy in blue overalls and
cotton shirt, lying on his back amid the wild
oats of a golden land, his eyes to the sky, watching
up there the free wide circle of a hawk&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Soy, Mister, wot the deuce do you think
you're doing?" shouted a husky and protesting
voice in his ear.</p>

<p>And Charles-Norton came back precipitously
to the present. By his side a pale youth was
squirming indignantly. Charles-Norton's elbow
was in the youth's ribs, and his elbow was still
stirring with the last oscillation of the movement
that had agitated it. "Soy," cried the
youth in disgust; "d'yous think you's a
chicken?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Charles-Norton, in
an agony of humility; "I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>But the youth refused to be mollified. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
he said nothing more, he kept upon Charles-Norton
the snarl of his pale face and at regular intervals
rubbed his ribs as though they pained
him exceedingly. Charles-Norton was glad to
reach his station.</p>

<p>That morning, in his glass cage, he muddled
his columns several times. He was far from an
admirable accountant at his best; but this day
he was what he termed "the limit." Totals fled
him like birds, with a whir of wings. A sun-gleam
hypnotized him once, for he did not know
how long; and his nose, a little later, followed
for several gymnastic minutes the flutter of a
white moth.</p>

<p>At lunch, in Konrad's Bakery, he found himself
seated, by a singular chance, next to the very
same youth whose ribs he had crushed on the
Elevated a few hours before. The young man
was in more amiable mood. He grinned. "Don't
you flap again and spill me coffee, Mr. Chicken,"
he said, with delicate persiflage.</p>

<p>"I won't," said Charles-Norton. "I'll buy
you another cup if I do."</p>

<p>"Got a dollar?" asked the youth, irrelevantly.
His thin, pale nose quivered a bit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't know," said Charles-Norton, hesitatingly.
Dollars were big in his budget. "Why?"</p>

<p>The youth drew from a pocket a yellow cardboard.
"Got a lottery ticket I want to sell,"
he said easily. "Little Texas. Hundred
Thousand first prize and lots of other prizes.
Got to sell it to pay me lunch. Played the
ponies yesterday."</p>

<p>Charles-Norton eyed the ticket doubtfully.
Usually, he would not have considered the matter
a moment. But somehow the incident of the
morning had placed him at a disadvantage toward
the pale youth. Vaguely he was moved
by a wish to regain by some act the respect of
this exacting person. He bought the ticket.</p>

<p>"Maybe this was the foolish act that all this
flapping announced," he said to himself, once
outside, in answer to a not uncertain prick of
his marital conscience. "Buying this ticket is
like buying a lightning-rod; it may draw off the
lightning!"</p>

<p>But his singular malady, during the afternoon,
did not disappear. It waxed, in fact; it
passed the borders of the spiritual and assumed
physical symptoms. "Dolly," he said, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
was again within the warmth of the little flat
in the evening; "Dolly, would you mind looking
at my shoulders after a while?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I'll look at them, Goosie,"
answered Dolly, immediately alert at the possibility
of doing something for the big man; "what
is the matter with your shoulders, Goosie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, sinking a bit wearily
into the Morris chair. "They pain; just like
rheumatism or growing pain. And they tickle
too, Dolly; they tickle all the time." He crossed
his arms, raising a hand to each shoulder, and
rubbed them with a shiver of delight. "It's a
nuisance," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see about it right away," said
Dolly. "Right after supper." Her eyes grew
big with concern. "You may have caught cold.
Come on, dear," she said, brightening; "I've the
dandiest, deliciousest soup, right out of the
<i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, for you!"</p>

<p class="cap">"Why, Goosie; I tell you the lumps are
growing. They're great big now,
Goosie. Oh, why don't you let me
take you to the doctor! I <i>know</i> something is the
matter!"</p>

<p>Dolly had tears in her eyes almost, and her
voice was very dolorous. For the fourteenth
time in two weeks, she was treating the singular
shoulders of Charles-Norton. He was sitting
beneath the glow of the evening lamp, his
coat off, his shirt pulled down to his elbows; and
she, standing behind the chair, was leaning solicitously
over him. A wisp of her hair caressed
his right ear, but somehow did not relax his temper.
"Well, let them alone, Dolly," he growled;
"let them alone. Good Lord, let them alone!"</p>

<p>For two weeks he had been getting more and
more peevish. To be sure, for two weeks, daily,
his shoulders had been washed and rubbed and
massaged and lotioned and parboiled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
anointed and fomented and capsicon-plastered,
till his very soul was sensitive and a suspicion
was agrowl within him&mdash;a bad, mean feeling that
Dolly was finding a bit, just a bit, of something
akin to pleasure in the ardor of her ministrations.
Besides, he was fighting a moral fight of
his own. Great bursts of dissatisfaction swept
through him every day now; and it was only by
a constant vigilance that he kept his vagrant elbows
close to his ribs.</p>

<p>"Let them be for a while, Dolly," he repeated
in gentler tone. "Besides&mdash;besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he left unsaid the thought following the
"besides." "Now, dear," said Dolly, kindly, but
with a certain firmness; "you've simply got to
let me see what I can do. Why, Goosie, you can't
go on in this way! You'd be getting humps on
your back! No&mdash;no; we'll try a nice little ice-pack
to-night."</p>

<p>"I don't want any ice-packs!" yelped Charles-Norton
(what a bad-mannered young man he
had become!); "I'm tired of fomentations and
things! Besides"&mdash;and this time the besides did
not pause, but burst out of him like a stream
from a high-pressure hydrant&mdash;"besides, it isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
what I want&mdash;&mdash;" And to an irresistible impulse
his right hand reached out for a brush and, crossing
over to his left shoulder, began rubbing it
vigorously.</p>

<p>"Goosie, Goosie, my clothes-brush, my best
clothes-brush!"</p>

<p>But the lament in Dolly's voice had little
effect upon Charles-Norton. He was brushing
himself with grave concentration. "Get the
flesh-brush," he mumbled between set teeth, rubbing
the while; "Gee, this feels good. Get the
pack to-night."</p>

<p>Dolly ran into the bath-room and returned
with the flesh-brush; Charles-Norton made an
exchange without losing a stroke. "That's something
like it," he murmured.</p>

<p>"But, Goosie," began Dolly. Her voice was
low now; she stood withdrawn from him as if a
bit afraid; her hands were clasped and her lips
trembled. "Goosie, dear; don't do that. Oh,
don't; you'll hurt yourself. It's getting all red,
Goosie. You're rubbing the skin off, I tell you.
Why, it's almost bleeding&mdash;Goosie, Goosie, stop
it, stop it!"</p>

<p>"Feels lots better," he said unfeelingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>"Look at it." And transferring the brush to
his left hand, he began to rub the right
shoulder, raising his left for Dolly's inspection.</p>

<p>She approached timidly. "You've rubbed all
the poor skin off," she announced. "It's bleeding."
He felt the light touch of her fingers.
"Why, Goosie&mdash;there's something&mdash;something.
Why, Goosie!"</p>

<p>The last was almost a cry, and the silence that
followed had an awe-stricken pulse. "What is
it?" he asked, still busily brushing.</p>

<p>"Why, there's something"&mdash;again he felt the
tender touch of her fingers&mdash;"there're a lot of
little things&mdash;a lot of little things pricking right
through the skin!"</p>

<p>"Let me rub it some more," he said, transferring
the brush. "Now, look at it," he said, after
several more vigorous minutes of his strange
treatment.</p>

<p>"Goosie!"</p>

<p>This time it was a cry to stab the heart. He
dropped the brush and looked up at her. She
was pale, and her eyes were very big. "Well,
what is the matter now," he asked impatiently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>She came near again, still pale, but with lips
tight. "A-ouch!" he yelped.</p>

<p>For with a sudden sharp movement, she had
plucked something out of his shoulder. A smart
came into his eyes; it was as if a lock of hair had
been pulled out by the roots. "Look at this,
Goosie," she said with forced calmness, and
placed something in his hand.</p>

<p>It was very small and very soft. He dropped
his eyes upon it as it lay lightly in his palm.
"Good lord!" he ejaculated, his bad humor gone
suddenly into a genuine concern; "Good Lord!"
he said, rising to his feet in consternation; "it's
a; it's a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a feather," said Dolly, with sepulchral
finality; "it's a feather."</p>

<p>It was a feather&mdash;a soft, downy, white, baby
feather. Charles-Norton looked at it long,
as it lay, shivering slightly, there in his palm.
He took it up and passed the luster of it slowly
through his fingers. Something like a smile
gradually came into his face. He raised the
feather against the light of the lamp. His eyes
brightened.</p>

<p>"Isn't it pretty, Dolly?" he said. "Isn't it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
pretty? just look at it. So white, and fresh, and
new, and glistening. And see the curve, the
slender curve of it&mdash;oh, Dolly, isn't it pretty and
fine?"</p>

<p>But Dolly, collapsed in a chair, broke out
a-crying. "Oh, Goosie, Goosie, what are we going
to do now?" she wailed; "what are we to do?
O&mdash;O&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Charles-Norton, the spirit of
contradiction which for several days had been
within him rising to his lips; "well, <i>I</i> don't see
what there is to make so much fuss about. A
few feathers are not going to hurt a man, are
they? 'Tisn't as if I were insane, or had hydrophobia!"</p>

<p>"But, Goosie, Goosie, <i>no</i> one has feathers on
his shoulders! No one <i>ever</i> had feathers on his
shoulders! No other man <i>in the world</i> ever did
that; none in the world <i>ever</i> had feathers on his
shoulders that way! Oh, Goosie, Goosie, what
shall we do!!!"</p>

<p>"Let them alone," said Charles-Norton, now
quite vexed. "They're mine; they don't hurt
<i>you</i>, do they? Let 'em alone!" He raised his
arms and began to slip his shirt up again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>The tears ceased to drip from Dolly's eyes.
"You can't do that," she said, a maternal firmness
coming into her voice. "Why, Goosie, what
would they think of you down at the office?"</p>

<p>"At the office? Why, they won't know it!"</p>

<p>"But <i>you'll</i> know it, Goosie. All the time,
you'll know it. Goosie, you don't want to be
different, do you? You want to be like other
men, don't you? You don't want to be <i>different</i>?"</p>

<p>This argument had some effect on Charles-Norton.
He stood very still, scratching his head
pensively. "Well," he said finally, "maybe
you're right. Maybe we had better keep them cut
short."</p>

<p>"Oh, Goosie!" cried Dolly, joyously, and
bounded from the room. She came running back
with the scissors. "Come, quick!" she panted.
"I'll cut them, short. 'Twon't be much trouble
after all, will it? I'll cut them every day. It
will be just like shaving&mdash;no more trouble than
that!"</p>

<p>And she slid the scissors along Charles-Norton's
skin with a cold, decisive little zip. He
could see her head, cocked a bit side-ways with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
concentration, reflected in the glass panes of the
side-board as she cut and cut, closer and closer.
Her rosy nostrils were distended slightly; upon
her tight lip the tip of a small white tooth
gleamed. A light shiver passed along Charles-Norton's
spine. "Gee, I didn't think she could
look like this," he thought.</p>

<p class="cap">Following this little disturbance the
Sims couple, lowering their heads, side
by side, resolutely regained the smooth
rut of their placid existence. Everything in this
world is easier than is imagined. Much easier.
In the case of the Sims' household, it was just a
matter of adding each morning, to the daily shave
of Charles-Norton, another operation quite as
facile.</p>

<p>"Dolly," he would call, as soon as his hot
towel had removed from his ruddy cheeks the
last bubbles of lather.</p>

<p>And Dolly, her hungry little scissors agleam
in her hand, trotted in alacriously. She sat
Charles-Norton on the edge of the tub and bent
over him her happy, humming head. Zip-zip-zip,
went the scissors, zip-zip&mdash;and a soft white
fluff that looked like the stuffing of a pillow (an
A-one pillow; not the kind upon which Charles-Norton
and Dolly laid their modest heads)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
eddied slowly to Charles-Norton's feet while he
shivered slightly to the coldness of the steel.
(Dolly cut very close.)</p>

<p>Then, "All right; all done," she sang, dropping
the scissors into the round pocket of her
crackling apron; "now to breakfast, quick! And
here's a kiss for the good boy."</p>

<p>Placing her red lips upon his, she whisked off
to the kitchenette; and Charles-Norton, emerging
all dressed a little later, found the cheerful
blue ware on the table, and his waffles upon his
plate, hot beneath his napkin. After which,
stuffing the morning paper into his pocket, he
departed with another kiss on the landing,
and strode forth for the L. Life was just as
before.</p>

<p>And yet, not quite. Because, to tell the truth,
Charles-Norton was not absolutely happy.</p>

<p>He could not have told what was the matter.
Mostly, it was an emptiness. An emptiness is
hard to analyze. He knew that there was much
of which he should be content. With the careful
repression of the vagaries of his shoulders,
there had come to him a new attentiveness at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
work. His nose, now, never wandered after passing
butterflies, and his salary had been raised to
twenty-two dollars a week. Also, the ridiculous
flapping had gone, and the impulse to draw fool
lines upon a card.</p>

<p>But with these&mdash;and that was the trouble&mdash;other
things had vanished. That deep filling of
his lungs with spring, for instance. And the
longing that went with it. That was it&mdash;the
longing. He longed for the longing&mdash;if that is
comprehensible. He longed vaguely for a longing
that had been his, and which was gone. He
never saw, now, a land that was as a golden pool
beneath a turquoise dome; nor a boy in the wild
oats watching a circling hawk.</p>

<p>And there was something else, something more
definite. He felt that Dolly&mdash;yes, Dolly took
too much pleasure, altogether too much pleasure
in that clipping business. Of course, the clipping
had to be. He knew that. A respectable
man can't have feathers on his shoulders. It
was necessary. But somehow he would have
felt that necessity more, if Dolly had felt it&mdash;less.
He would have liked a chance to voice it
himself. If Dolly, now, only would, some fine
morning, say, "Oh, Goosie, let them be to-day;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
they are so pretty," then he could have answered,
very firmly, "No, clip away!" But she never
gave him that chance. She was always so radiantly
ready! As he watched her head in the
mirror, bent upon the busy scissors with an expression
of tight determination, a distinct irritation
seized him sometimes.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, in short, was accumulating,
drop by drop, a masculine grouch. A grouch
deeper than he realized, till that morning.</p>

<p>That morning Dolly, in the midst of the daily
operation, paused with scissors in air, a sudden
inspiration upon her brow.</p>

<p>"Oh, Goosie," she exclaimed; "How would it
be to cauterize them?"</p>

<p>Charles-Norton gave a jump. "Cauterize!"
he cried; "cauterize what?"</p>

<p>"Why, the little feathers. Supposing we
burned the place, you know, with nitrate of silver,
or something like that. They do it to people
who have moles&mdash;or when they have been bitten
by a mad dog. Maybe&mdash;maybe it would stop it&mdash;altogether."</p>

<p>Charles-Norton looked up at her. Her cheeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span
>were rosy, her eyes were bright; she was excited
and pleased with her ingenious idea. A
cold wave rose about Charles-Norton and closed
over his head. "Say,'" he bawled ungraciously;
"what do you take me for! Think I'm made of
asbestos?"</p>

<p>Discreet Dolly immediately dropped the subject;
though somehow Charles-Norton had the
distinct impression that it was only discreetly
that she did so, that, in fact, she was not dropping
the idea, but merely tucking it away somewhere
within the secret hiding-places of her being,
for further use. He could still see it, in
fact, graven there upon the whiteness of her
voluntary little forehead.</p>

<p>He brooded black over it all day. He brooded
on other things, too&mdash;insignificant things that
had happened in the past, that had not mattered
one whit then, but which now, beneath his fostering
care, began to grow into big, flapping boog-a-boos.
And when he returned that night, he
was a very mean Charles-Norton. He spoke
hardly a word at dinner, pretended he did not
like the vanilla custard over which Dolly had
toiled all day, her soul aglow with creative delight,
sipped but half of his demi-tasse (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
though the coffee were bitter, which it wasn't),
and went off to bed early with a good-night so
frigid that Dolly's little nose tingled for several
minutes afterward.</p>

<p>And the next morning, when Dolly, astonished
at the delay, finally peeped into the bath-room,
scissors in hand, she found Charles-Norton
fully dressed, his coat on.</p>

<p>"Why, Goosie," she said in surprise; "I
haven't clipped you yet!"</p>

<p>"No?" he growled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"Take off your coat, dearie," she went on.</p>

<p>"And you're not going to," said Charles-Norton,
finishing his statement with complete disregard
of hers.</p>

<p>Dolly stood there a moment, looking at him
with head slightly cocked to one side. "All
right, Goosie," she said cheerily. "Only, don't
get mad at poor little me. Come on to breakfast,
you big, shaggy bear, you!"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>want</i> any breakfast," growled
Charles-Norton between closed teeth (as a matter
of fact, he did, and a fragrance of waffles
from the kitchen was at the moment profoundly
agitating the pit of his being). "I don't <i>want</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
any breakfast&mdash;where's my hat&mdash;quick, I'm in
a hurry&mdash;good-by."</p>

<p>And tossing the hat bellicosely upon his head,
he pulled to himself the hall door, swaggered
through, and let it slam back on his departing
heels, right before the astonished nose of his
little wife.</p>

<p>She remained there before this rude door, examining
its blank surface with a sort of objective
curiosity. At the same time she was listening
to the sound of steps gradually diminishing
down the five flights. She shook her head; "the
bad, bad boy!" she said.</p>

<p>She pivoted with a shrug of the shoulders and
went back to the kitchen and sat down at the
table, all set for breakfast. She took up her fork
and cut off a bit of waffle. She placed it in her
mouth. Her eyes went off far away.</p>

<p>It took it a long time, this little piece of waffle,
to go down. Lordie, what a tough, resilient,
flannelly, bit of waffle this was! Suddenly her
head went forward. It lit upon the table, in her
hands. A cup of the precious blue ware, dislodged,
balanced itself a moment on the edge of
the table, then, as if giving up hope, let go and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
crashed to the floor at her feet in many pieces.
She gave it no heed. Her head was in her hands,
her hands were on the table, her hair lay like a
golden delta among plates and saucers; and the
table trembled.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Meanwhile Charles-Norton was not
having such a good time either. Starting
off swaggeringly, he had halted
three times on his way to the station, and three
times had taken at least two steps back toward
the flat which he felt desolate behind him. And
now in his glass cage, a weight was at his
stomach, a constant weight like an indigestible
plum-pudding. At regular intervals, as he bent
over his books, he felt his heart descend swiftly
to the soles of his feet; he paled at the sight of
a telegraph messenger, at the sound of the telephone
bell. He had visions of hospitals&mdash;of a
white cot to which he was brought, a white cot
about which grave men stood hopelessly, and on
the pillow of which spread a cascade of golden
hair. Too imaginative, this Charles-Norton, too
imaginative altogether!</p>

<p>He did not know that after a while Dolly had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
risen, and a bit wearily, with heavy sighs, had
washed the dishes; that after this she had put
the little flat in order; that during this operation,
in spite of her best efforts, she had felt her
woe slowly oozing from her; that the provisioning
tour in the street and stores gay with gossipy,
bargaining young matrons, had almost completed
this process; and that a providential peep
in a milliner's window, which had suddenly
solved for her the harassing problem of the
spring hat (she had seen one she liked and with
a flash of inspiration had seen how she could
make one just like it out of her old straw and
some feathers long at the bottom of her trunk)
had sent her bounding back up her five flights of
stairs with a song purring in her heart.</p>

<p>So that when, returning in the evening,
Charles-Norton opened the door with bated
breath, to find Dolly humming happily in the
kitchen, he was struck by something like disappointment.
"She's shallow," he thought;
"doesn't feel." He did not mean by this, of
course, that he wished she had in despair done
something catastrophic. He meant merely&mdash;well,
he did not know what he meant. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
disillusioned, that was all. This was but a prosy
world after all. Few Heroics here!</p>

<p>And immediately a warning knocked at his
consciousness. He must be careful if he were
to hold what advantage he had gained in the
day. He turned from the kitchen threshold and
silently slunk back into the room which was
both dining and sitting-room, and isolated himself
behind the spread pages of the evening
paper. He was curt and cold the entire evening.
And in the morning he again left with calculated
violence&mdash;breakfastless and unsheared.</p>

<p>This time, Dolly did not weep. She sat long
on the edge of her bed, thinking silently; then a
silver rocket of sound broke the sepulchral quiet
of the flat. Dolly had had a vision of what must
inevitably happen; and Dolly was laughing.</p>

<p>It took just ten days to happen&mdash;ten days
which were rather disagreeable, of course, but
which Dolly, sure of the trumps in her little
hands, bore with jolly fortitude. All that time,
Charles-Norton glowered constantly. He was
monosyllabic and ostentatiously unhappy. This
more than was necessary, and very deliberate.
It had to be deliberate; for, as a matter of fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
on the outside Charles was not having at all a
bad time.</p>

<p>The exaltation of the ante-clipping days had returned&mdash;returned
heightened, and was still
growing day by day. A constant joyous babbling,
as of some inexhaustible spring, lay at
the bottom of his soul. His senses were singularly
acute. He thrilled to a leaf, to a bud, to
a patch of blue sky; and the thrill remained
long, a profound satisfaction within him, after
the stimulant had gone. With the resolution of
a roué plunging back into his vice after an enforced
vacation, he had brought a large sketch
book; and he passed much time drawing lines
into it&mdash;rapid beauty streaks that gave him a
sensation of birds. He saw often, now, a land
which was as a pool of gold beneath a turquoise
sky; and a boy in the wild oats watching a
circling hawk. At such times his lungs filled
deep with the spring, and his arms were apt to
beat at his sides in rapid tattoo. This, in fact
made up solely his morning exercises now.
Standing with legs close together, a-tip-toe, head
back and chest forward, placing his hands beneath
his shoulders he waved his arms up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
down in a beat that rose in fervid crescendo, till
his eyes closed and there went through him a
soaring ecstasy that threatened at times to lift
him from the floor.</p>

<p>All this, of course, was not without its disadvantage.
Vaguely he felt that in some subtle
way he was gaining the disapproval of his fellows.
Men were apt to look at him askance, half
doubtful, half-indignant. They tread on his toes
in the Elevated. His work, too, was going to
pot; he could not stick to his figures. His chief,
an old fragile-necked book-keeper, had spoken to
him once.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sims," he had said, after a preliminary
little cough; "Mr. Sims, you ought to take care
of your health. You are not well."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes I am," answered Charles-Norton, absent-mindedly.
His eyes were on the ceiling,
where a fly was buzzing. "I'm all right!"</p>

<p>"You should&mdash;er&mdash;you should consult&mdash;a
specialist, Mr. Sims. Don't you know&mdash;your
shoulders, your back&mdash;you should consult a
spine-specialist, Mr. Sims."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Charles-Norton,
easily. "Don't worry." And thus he had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
back the old gentleman baffled to his high
stool.</p>

<p>And then came Dolly's day.</p>

<p>"Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!"</p>

<p>It was morning, before breakfast. Charles-Norton
was in the bedroom; Dolly was setting
the table in the living-room. She paused, and
stood very still, while a little knowing smile
parted her lips.</p>

<p>"Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!" Again came the
call, unmistakable, music to Dolly's ear. She
tip-toed to the door. From within sounded a
threshing noise, as of a whale caught in shallows.
"Yes. What is it?" she called back melodiously,
mastering her desire to rush in.</p>

<p>"Come here, Dolly," said the male voice.
"Come here."</p>

<p>"I'm coming," said Dolly, and went in with
a slightly bored expression.</p>

<p>"Help me, Dolly," said the perspiring and be-ruffled
gentleman within. "I can't&mdash;can't&mdash;get
my coat on."</p>

<p>"Why, Goosie; of course I'll help you."</p>

<p>But the help, although almost sincere, was
powerless. The coat would not go on. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
sleeves rose to the elbows smoothly, half way to
the shoulders with more effort&mdash;but here they
stuck, refusing to slide over the top of the shoulders.
On each side of the spine, almost cracking
the shirt, a protuberance bulged which the
coat could not leap.</p>

<p>He stood there puffing, his hair mussed up,
his eyes wrathful. "Well," he growled at
length; "why don't you go get your scissors."</p>

<p>"Shall I?" she said doubtfully&mdash;and at the
same time bounced out like a little rabbit.
"Take off your shirt, Goosie," she said, returning
with the gleaming instruments, now symbolical
of her superior common-sense.</p>

<p>She aided him. She took off his collar and
tie, unfastened the buttons, and then she was
tugging at the shirt. It slid down, uncovering
the shoulders. There was a dry, crackling sound,
as of a fan stretched open&mdash;and Dolly sat down
on the floor. "Oh-oh-oh," she cried, "Go-oo-oo-ssie-ie!"</p>

<p>He stood there, looking out of the corner of
his eye at his reflection in the mirror, red-faced
and very much abashed. For with the slipping
of the shirt, on his shoulders there had sprung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
with the movement of a released jack-in-the-box,
two vibrant white things.</p>

<p>Two gleaming, lustrous, white things that
were&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"They're wings," said Dolly, still on the floor.
"<i>They are wings</i>," she repeated, in the tone of
one saying, <i>He is dead</i>. "Now, Goosie, you <i>have</i>
done it!"</p>

<p>But a change had come in Charles-Norton.
The blush had left his brow, the foolish expression
his face; he was pivoting before the mirror
like a woman with a new bonnet.</p>

<p>"I <i>like</i> them," he said.</p>

<p>And then, "Just look at them, Dolly. Just
look at the curve of them. Isn't it a beautiful
curve! And the whiteness of them, Dolly&mdash;like
a baby's soul. And how downy&mdash;soft like you,
Dolly. Look at them gleam. And they move,
Dolly, they move! Dolly, oh, look!"</p>

<p>The wings were gently breathing; their slender
tips struck his waist at each oscillation. The
movement quickened, became a beat, a rapid palpitation.
A soft whirring sound filled the room;
the newspaper on the bed, dislodged, eddied to
the floor; the wings were a mere white blur.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Suddenly Charles-Norton's feet left the floor,
and he rose slowly into the air. "Look, look,
Dolly," he cried, as he went up, hovering above
her up-tilted nose and her wide eyes, as she sat
there, paralyzed, upon the ground; "Dolly,
look!"</p>

<p>The humming sound took a higher note; a picture
crashed down; the room was a small cyclone.
"Dolly, watch me; look!"</p>

<p>And with a sudden leap, Charles-Norton
slanted up toward the ceiling and lit, seated, on
the edge of the shelf that went along the four
walls. "Look," he said with triumph, balancing
smilingly on his perch.</p>

<p>But immediately his expression changed to
one of concern, and he sprang down quickly and
quietly. Dolly was now stretched full-length
along the carpet; her face was in her arms. He
turned it to the light. Her eyes were closed.</p>

<p>Dolly had fainted.</p>

<p class="cap">A husband who has a wife that faints is
in the grasp of the great It.</p>

<p>Full of fear, pity, remorse, and self-hatred,
Charles-Norton danced about helplessly
for several minutes, sprinkling water upon
Dolly's brow (much of it went down her neck);
trying to pour bad whiskey between her pearly
teeth; calling himself names; chafing her hands,
promising to be good, to do always what she
wanted; loosening her garments; proclaiming the
fact that he was a brute, she an angel&mdash;while the
wings, loose down his back, flapped after him in
long, mournful gestures. And when finally, from
the couch upon which he had drawn her, Dolly
opened upon him her blue eyes, humid as twin
stars at dawn, he placed her little scissors in her
hand, and with head bowed low, in an ecstatic
agony of self-renunciation bade her do her duty.
The little scissors could not do it this time,
though. It took the shears.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>After which there were a mingling of tears,
murmurings, embraces, and Dolly said that the
bad, bad times were all over now, and he agreed
that they could never come again; and she said
they would be happy ever afterward, and he
agreed they should be happy always. Then
Dolly, still a bit languid, in a voice still a bit
doleful, drove him off to the office.</p>

<p>Where he arrived very late, and had to pass
the gauntlet of his chiefs frigid ignoring of the
dereliction.</p>

<p>When Charles-Norton had gone, Dolly suddenly
sat up with a click of small heels upon the
floor. She remained thus some time, a frown
between her eyes. She was not triumphant, she
was worried. She seemed to recognize danger;
her transparent nostrils dilated to the smell of
powder; and plainly, you could see her steel her
being. After a while she nodded to herself,
curtly and very decidedly, and went on about
her work.</p>

<p>She met Charles-Norton at the door when he
returned in the evening. He was somewhat
limp after a day of <i>mea culpas</i>! and she, a quarter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of an hour before the time for his reappearance,
had powdered her nose&mdash;which, she knew,
gave her an expression half amusing, half piteous,
just like that of the clown who is playing
his tricks at the circus while his little daughter
is dying at home. "Hello, Goosie," she said
breathlessly (also she had rubbed a trace of
rouge under her eyes); "hello, just in time for
dinner! Made a fine chocolate cake. Poor dear,
you look so tired!"</p>

<p>And after supper, which in spite of Dolly's
very ostensible effort at exuberance, was rather
silent, for Charles-Norton, with a man's detestation
of "scenes," still felt somewhat embarrassed
at the happenings of the morning, she drew up
the Morris chair to the lamp, sat Charles-Norton
in it, and filled his pipe for him. When thus
"fixed up comfy," he felt a soft breath upon
his neck, and two little hands at his neck-tie.
Off came tie and collar, and then the coat, and
then the shirt, and then&mdash;zip-zip.</p>

<p>"Say, Dolly," he remonstrated mildly;
"couldn't you wait till morning?"</p>

<p>"There," she said; "it's almost all done. Just
a wee bit more here. There! Now here is a
kiss! It didn't hurt, Goosie, did it?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>And Charles-Norton had to concede that it did
not hurt. How could he have explained the
subtle feeling within him, that sort of swooping
descent of his inwards that came with, and the
dullness of all things which followed always his
shearings?</p>

<p>"No, it didn't hurt," he repeated. But a
vague dissatisfaction like a yeast stirred within
him, and a flicker,&mdash;beaten down immediately,
it is true, trampled, smothered,&mdash;of revolt.</p>

<p>Calmly, coolly, efficiently, though, Dolly had
taken the upper hand. The next morning she
sent him sheared to the office; she sent him
sheared the same night to bed.</p>

<p>And thus day after day for many days. Every
morning Charles-Norton went out to his work
full of emptiness (if that phrase is permissible),
empty of heart, empty of mind, without a desire,
without an anger. The warm June days had
come; he had changed his underwear. He felt
the season only as a discomfort. The emerald
explosions visible at the end of each street as
the L train passed along Central Park did not
stir him; the tepid airs drifting lazily from the
sea, the fragrant whiffs from the depths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
germinating land, passed over him as though he
were made of asbestos. An insulation was about
him, removing him from all things that thrill,
all things that distend; there was no color, no
vibration in the world; iridescences had ceased;
the chamber of his soul had been painted a dull
drab.</p>

<p>He had regained, though, the esteem of his fellows.
The subtle and unerring instinct which
had made them suspicious in the days of his&mdash;misfortune,
now in the same inexplicable way
told them that he was normal again. They
looked at him no longer askance. In fact, they
did not look at him at all. They accepted him
without question in crush of street and L; gave
him his rightful space (nine and a half inches in
diameter); trod on his feet only when forced to
(by the impulse to obtain a more comfortable
position); poked their elbows into his stomach
only when necessary (that is, when they had to
get out or in ahead of him); and on the whole
surrounded him with that indifference which at
the bottom is a sort of regard, which means that
one conforms, that one's derby, sack-suits, socks
and shoes, habits, ideas, morals and religion are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
just exactly like the derbies, sack-suits, socks and
shoes, habits, ideas, morals and religion of everyone
else, and hence right. At the office he had
regained the appreciation of his chiefs; his salary
had been raised to twenty-two dollars and a
half a week and his working hours from eight to
nine hours. His home life was the standard
ideal one. That is, he got up at the same time
every morning, left punctually at the same hour,
took the L, arrived at the office on the minute,
worked with his nose close to the ruled pages,
steadily, without a distraction, till 12.30, had
his macaroon tart and cup of coffee at Konrad's
Bakery, smoked his five-cent cigar in the nearby
square till 1.30, worked again till 5.30, returned
home on the L, pressed tight like a lamb on the
way to the packing-house, had a cozy little dinner
upon which Dolly had spent all her ingenuity,
smoked his pipe in the Morris chair, and
then read the paper till the sudden contact of his
chin with his chest and Dolly's amused warning
sent him off to bed. A very moral, regular,
exemplary existence. Dolly was very happy.</p>

<p>And then, just as this couple could see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
track clear ahead, stretching smooth and nickel-plated
to infinity, an ugly complication began
to worm itself into the serenity of their
lives.</p>

<p>This complication arose from the fact that the
suppressed wings of Charles-Norton began to
grow faster. Each day, now, Charles-Norton,
returning home, brought with him to Dolly a
task more serious and considerable. She had
long ago discarded the little scissors and used
special shears made to cut heavy cardboard;
and she finished off with a safety razor.</p>

<p>The result of this increase in the rate of
winged growth was that, whereas Charles-Norton
every morning left home placid and docile,
his character gradually changed during the day.
Starting at his work in the spirit of a blind
horse at the mill, by ten o'clock he was apt to
find himself, pen-holder in mouth, nose up in the
air, following the evolutions of a buzzing flylet.
By eleven o'clock, the cage had become very
stuffy; spasmodic intakes swelled his chest,
ghost longings stirred within him. When he got
out at 12.30 the sun seemed to pour right through
his skin, into the drab chamber of his soul, gilding
it. He hurried over his macaroon tart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
cup of coffee, and then had three-quarters of an
hour left to idle in the square.</p>

<p>He prepared for this gravely, as for a ceremony;
first by buying a Pippin. A slender,
light-brown Pippin, scientifically sprinkled with
golden freckles, for five cents. (A daily Pippin
was a recognized item of the family budget; at
one time Charles Norton had carried his pipe
with him, but Dolly, noticing the doubtful fragrance
given by said pipe to the clothes of
Charles-Norton, had insisted upon the extravagance
of the daily Pippin). Having bought the
Pippin, Charles-Norton did not light it right
away. Oh, no. He ambled first to the square.
He selected his bench carefully&mdash;one upon which
the sun shone, but shone with a light filtered by
the leaves of a low-branching elm. He sat down;
he stretched his legs straight before him. Then
slowly, with deliberation of movement, he
scratched a match. He brought the spluttering
end near his nose. The Pippin began to send
forth effluvia, an exquisite vapor, faintly-blue.
Charles-Norton half closed his eyes; his soul began
to purr.</p>

<p>Before him a fountain plashed; about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
fountain were red blossoms; the elms rustled
gently against the blue sky; through the delicate
lace of their leaves the sun eddied down like a
very light pollen; and all this, through the Pippin's
exquisite atmosphere, was enveloped and
smoothed and glazed into a picture&mdash;a slightly
hazy dream-picture. Charles-Norton stretched
his legs still more; his shoulders rose along the
sides of his head. He was as at the bottom of
the sea&mdash;a warm and quiet summer sea. Down
through its golden-dusty waters, a streak of sun,
polished like a rapier, diagonaled, striking him
on the breast; and to its vivifying burn he felt
within him his heart expand, as though it would
bloom, like the red flowers about the fountain.</p>

<p>Upon the other benches sprawled some of the
city's derelicts. The sun was upon them also;
they stirred uneasily to its caress, with sighs
and groans, their warped bodies, petrified with
the winter's long cold, distending slowly in pain.
Pale children in their buggies slept with mouths
open, gasping like little fish; some played upon
the asphalt.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, by this time, was apt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
far away; far in another land. He lay upon his
back and watched a hawk on high.</p>

<p>The sparrows usually brought him back.
They played about his feet; they chirped, hopped,
and tattled; they peered side-ways at him and
gave him jerky nods of greeting. At times one
of them, to a sudden inspiration, sprang into
the air; with a whir he flashed up to the top
of a tree. To the movement, something within
Charles-Norton leaped to his throat.</p>

<p>Across the park, gaunt behind the trees, rose
the tall steel frame of a new building; and away
up at the top of it (which was higher every day)
a workingman, on a girder, ate his lunch.
Charles-Norton liked this man; a current of
comradeship always ran from him to the little
figure silhouetted up against the blue. He should
have liked to eat his lunch up there, side by side
with this man, his legs swinging next to his, with
the void beneath. And then, he thought, after
lunching, he would like to stand erect, away up
there, at the tip edge of one of the projecting
beams; to stand there a bit, and then spring
off; spring off lightly, and whiz down; down,
down, down with outspread arms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Which was a very foolish thought for a man
that worked in a cage to dream. Very foolish,
even if the cage were of glass. Just about that
time the Pippin went out in a black smolder,
and from a nearby church, hidden between great
sky-scrapers, a big ding-dong bell said resonantly
that it was half-past one.</p>

<p>He returned to the office. Every afternoon,
now, was a tingling trial. He worked with head
down, sweating with repression. An obsession
tormented him. He wanted to walk out of his
glass cage. Out, not through the door, but
through the glass. Not gently, like Alice going
into Wonderland, but with ostentation and violence,
with a heralding crash of shattered panes,
scandalously. Out of his cage, into the next;
out of that, into the next; from one end of the big
room, in fact, to the other, crashingly, through
cage after cage&mdash;and then out upon the street
through the plate front. Half-past five finally
freed him; and taking his place in a packed
herring-box on wheels, he was rolled back to
Dolly&mdash;and the shearing.</p>

<p>Thus for a while did the young people live securely
on a clown's tissue-paper hoop. Then one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
evening, just as Charles-Norton, after successfully
resisting all day his anarchistic glass-smashing
impulse, was watching the hands of
the clock approach the minute that was to free
him, his chief, raising his bald head at the end
of his long, thin neck, said casually, "We work
all night, to-night, you know, Mr. Sims."</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<hr />

<p class="cap">"We work all night to-night, Mr. Sims."
It is always with just such a
sentence, quiet, drab, and seemingly
insignificant, that Mr. Catastrophe introduces
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Charles-Norton, adjusting his
neck-tie and looking at the calendar.</p>

<p>He was not surprised, for this happened twice
a year. Twice a year, on a day in December and
a day in June, a part of the force worked all night
to prepare a statistical table for the benefit of
the stockholders.</p>

<p>He telephoned to Dolly. Her voice came to
him over the wire in a scared little squeak.
"Oh, Goosie," she pleaded; "come up before
starting in again. I'll let you go off right away.
But please come up, please do!"</p>

<p>"Can't," shouted Charles-Norton. "We're
allowed only an hour for dinner, and it would
take more than that just to go up and back."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>"They won't care if you are a little late," suggested
Dolly.</p>

<p>"No, can't come up," said Charles-Norton,
astonished at his own firmness (it is much easier
to be firm over a telephone, anyway). "There's
too much to do. I'll be up in the morning,
maybe."</p>

<p>"But Goo-oo-sie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nope. Can't. Good-by, dearie," said
Charles-Norton, and hung up the receiver, and
with a bad conscience and a soaring heart, went
off to dinner. No shearing to-night&mdash;gee! He
ordered a dinner which made the red-headed
waitress gasp. "Must have got a raise, eh?"
she diagnosed.</p>

<p>"No, not a raise, not a raise," hummed
Charles-Norton; "skip now; I'm hungry."</p>

<p>The night was a long and toilsome one, but an
inexhaustible bubble was at the pit of Charles-Norton's
being; gradually through the night he
felt, beneath his coat, his shoulders deliciously
swelling. And when in the morning he stepped
out upon the sidewalk, a cry left his lips.</p>

<p>It had showered during the night, and to the
rising sun the whole city was glowing as with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
golden dew. The air was fresh; Charles-Norton
gulped it down. He felt as though a broad river
were streaming through him&mdash;a clear, cool river.
Suddenly, his heels snapped together, his head
went back; his hands rose to his armpits and
his arms began to vibrate up and down. A
policeman came running across the street. "Say,
wot de 'ell are you doing?" he bellowed, red-faced
and outraged.</p>

<p>"I'm going to breakfast," answered Charles-Norton,
cockily.</p>

<p>He went into the bakery, his hat a-tilt, with
the air of a conqueror. For he had decided not
to go up to the flat, but to breakfast right here
and to spend an hour in the square before going
back to the glass cage at nine. His chest pouted;
his eyes glistened; wine ran in his veins. He
ordered ham-and-eggs and hot-cakes. An orgy!</p>

<p>He was eating fast, in a hurry for the Pippin
and the loll on the bench, when he felt someone
sit down by him. There was a pause; then,
"hello, chicken!" piped a thin voice in his ear.</p>

<p>"Hello, Pinny," answered Charles-Norton,
even before looking. He had recognized the
voice of the pale youth whom he had elbowed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the L a few weeks before, and whom later he had
placated here in the bakery.</p>

<p>"S'pose you're a millionaire by this time,
chicken," said the youth, jocularly.</p>

<p>"Sure, Pinny," answered Charles-Norton.</p>

<p>"But really, honest, did yuh win anything?"
went on Pinny, more seriously.</p>

<p>"Win?" Suddenly Charles-Norton remembered
the lottery ticket that he had bought. He
had forgotten it completely. "The drawings
was three days ago," Pinny was saying; "got 'em
here," and out of his pocket he drew a soiled
newspaper clipping.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton also was searching his pockets
with much contortion; and it was some time
before his hand flashed out triumphantly with a
piece of dog-eared, yellow cardboard. "Wot's
your number?" asked Pinny.</p>

<p>"Nineteen thousand, eight hundred and
ninety-seven," Charles-Norton read.</p>

<p>Pinny was perusing the clipping in his hand.
"Wot did you say," he piped suddenly; "<i>wot's</i>
the number?"</p>

<p>"Nineteen thousand, eight hundred and
ninety-seven," repeated Charles-Norton.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>The pale youth seemed to collapse. His chin
went forward on his green tie, his back slid down
the back of his chair, his hands dropped limp
upon the table. "Well, I'll be eternally dod-gum-good-blasted,"
he said weakly.</p>

<p>"You've done it," he continued, solemnly;
"you've gone and done it." He looked at his
clipping again. "Lemme see your ticket," he
said. He placed the ticket and the clipping side
by side; his stubby, black-fringed finger slid
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"You've done it, partner," he repeated, with
the same funereal intoning. "Nineteen thousand,
eight hundred and ninety-seven! And I've
held that ticket in my hands, right in these
hands! Eight hundred dollars.&mdash;Nineteen thousand,
eight hundred and ninety-seven wins eight
hundred dollars"&mdash;his tongue lingered, as if it
tasted it, upon each opulent number&mdash;"Eight
hundred dollars; that's what you win. And all
owing to me, too."</p>

<p>Charles-Norton had forgotten his ham-and-eggs.
He took the ticket and the clipping from
Pinny's nerveless fingers and compared them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
19897! That was right. He had won eight hundred
dollars. "Where do you cash in?" he exclaimed
with a sudden ferocity.</p>

<p>"I'll take you to it," murmured Pinny, still in
a daze. "Gee&mdash;and I had that ticket in this here
pair of hands. I'll take yuh to it. It's down
town. No trouble getting the money. You'll
treat on it, eh? You'll treat, won't yuh?"</p>

<p>His sharp face was almost beneath Charles-Norton's
chin; his pale eyes rolled upward wistfully.
A sudden gust of pity went through
Charles-Norton. "Surely," he said. "Better
than that; we'll share." He paused, coughed.
A wave of prudence was modifying his impulse&mdash;the
prudence that inevitably comes with
wealth. "I'll give you&mdash;I'll give you twenty-five
dollars!" he announced.</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Pinny; "come on&mdash;we're
losing time, eating in this joint. Say, you'll have
all you want to eat now, won't yuh&mdash;oysters and
wine and grape-fruit and everything. And girls,
eh? Autos and wine and girls&mdash;Gee!" And his
eyes remained fixed on the vision of splendor, of
the splendor of Charles-Norton, missed so narrowly
by himself.</p>

<p>Together they went down to the offices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Little Texas, where after having been warmly
congratulated by an oily man with a diamond
stud, and after signing seven feet of documents
and testimonials, Charles-Norton was given a
long yellow check, which was forthwith photographed,
as was also Charles-Norton. Then the
fat, oily man, the clerk who had prepared the
documents, Pinny, and Charles-Norton went
downstairs and, standing up against a polished
walnut counter, drank to the long life of the Little
Texas and to the success of Charles-Norton.
After which the courteous oily man introduced
Charles-Norton to the cashier of a bank, where
Charles-Norton deposited his check, receiving in
return a little yellow deposit-book, and a long
green check-book.</p>

<p>With Pinny, Charles-Norton rode back toward
the office. They stopped at the square, and stood
a while watching the fountain, each a bit uncertain.
Finally Pinny put out his hand. "Well,
so long, old man," he said; "so long."</p>

<p>"So long," said Charles-Norton, indecisively.</p>

<p>But Pinny still stood there, abashed and uncertain.
"You was going to&mdash;but you've
changed yer mind, I suppose; I suppose you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
changed yer mind&mdash;You was going to&mdash;&mdash;" His
eyes were on the ground; he shuffled one foot
gently. "You was going to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course!" cried Charles-Norton. "I
was going to give you a share of the swag&mdash;of
course, of course, of course!"</p>

<p>They sat on a bench. Charles-Norton took out
of his pocket the long check-book and opened it
out, with a little crackling sound, on its first
clean page. He took out his fountain pen.
"No. 1," he wrote down with great decision. He
paused, looking about him for a moment, in enjoyment
of this new occupation. "June 19," he
wrote on, slowly, languorously. "Pay to the
order of," the page said next. "Of <i>Frank Theodore
Pinny</i>," wrote Charles-Norton. "Dollars,"
the check said next, at the end of a blank line.
Charles-Norton paused, pen poised above paper.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five," he thought. That is what he
had promised. "<i>T-w-e-n-t-y</i>," he wrote. The pen
stopped again, hovering hesitatingly above the
paper. "Twenty-five is a whole lot," he thought.
"Just for selling a ticket. Just for selling a
piece of cardboard!" And eight hundred dollars
was not so much, either. An hour before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
eight hundred dollars had seemed an immense
sum. Now it seemed a modest amount, a very
modest amount. And twenty-five, twenty-five
to give away&mdash;that seemed quite big. "Pay to
the order of Frank Theodore Pinny," he re-read,
"twenty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The pen made a sudden descent. "And no-hundredths,"
it wrote swiftly.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton signed the check, tore it from
the book, folded it, and presented it to Pinny, a
bit patronizingly. Pinny stuck it into a side
pocket without looking at it. He was standing
on one leg and seemed in a hurry to get away.
Charles-Norton, suddenly, had the same feeling.
The sense of comradeship which had been with
them for the last hour had abruptly flown with
this passing of money. Each man was embarrassed,
as before a stranger. "So long," said
Pinny; "so long," said Charles-Norton. Pinny,
with averted head, turned and walked away.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton pivoted on his heel, and
started for the office, worried suddenly by the
thought that he was late. He took three long
steps, collided with a sodden old gentleman who
was just arising from a bench&mdash;and then was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
standing very still, looking about him as in a
daze, unconscious of the mutter of apology which,
together with an odor of stale beer, was fermenting
beneath his nose. The old gentleman, pursuing
a ray of sun, slipped on to a farther bench.
But Charles-Norton still stood there, gazing
about him in a sort of mild astonishment, as if,
while he was not looking, the scene about him
had been transformed like so much cardboard
scenery.</p>

<p>To the shock of the collision, as to the stroke
of a finger upon a chemical beaker the reluctant
crystallization abruptly takes place, there had
come to Charles-Norton the realization <i>that he
did not have to go to the office</i>.</p>

<p>He did not have to go to the office! Here,
against his heart, represented by three black
figures within a little yellow book, was eight
hundred dollars, practically eight months'
salary, the assurance of eight months almost of
independence, of freedom!</p>

<p>"And Dolly?"</p>

<p>You will think, perhaps, that Charles-Norton
was seized by an ardent desire immediately to
run to Dolly, spring up the five flights of stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
push open the door, catch her by the waist and,
seating her on his knees, to pantingly tell her of
the wondrous news? You are mistaken.</p>

<p>For with the vision of Dolly, the thought that
irresistibly came to Charles-Norton was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That he didn't have to go to Dolly.</p>

<p>He didn't have to go to Dolly and be clipped.
He didn't have to go to the glass cage, and he
didn't have to go to Dolly. The scissors of
Dolly.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, very pale, his long, strong legs
trembling beneath him, sank upon the nearest
bench, and tried to catch hold of the world
again, of the reality of the world. His hands,
unconsciously expressing his mental attitude,
held the bench's rim tight with white knuckles.</p>

<p>Eight hundred dollars was not so much. Besides,
it was only seven hundred and eighty now.
And Dolly was a good little wife. A good, faithful,
loving little wife. In a few months the
money would all be gone if he stopped working.
If he went back to the office and worked, the
eight hundred (minus twenty) could be kept in
the savings bank as a precious resource against
ill-luck. And some of it could be used to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
things&mdash;furs for Dolly, for instance, brave little
Dolly. Her household allowance could be increased
a bit&mdash;brave, cheerful, careful, economical,
busy, loving little Dolly!</p>

<p>In the silence of his cogitation, Charles-Norton
suddenly heard with great distinctness a furtive
creaking within the shoulders of his coat.</p>

<p>"Dear Little Dolly!" he exclaimed ostentatiously,
making a brave effort to keep his eyes
upon his beacon.</p>

<p>But right from between his feet a sparrow,
like a firecracker exploding, sprang and went
whirring up in the sky. Charles-Norton followed
it with his eyes as it went winging, winging
up in a series of lines, each of which ended
in a droop, toward the high sky-scraper. And
when his eyes reached, with the bird, the top of
the building, they lit upon a cloud, a great white
galleon of a cloud which, with all sails set, flanks
opulently agleam with the swell of impalpable
freights, went sliding by with streaming pennons,
toward the West.</p>

<p>And Charles-Norton felt as though he were going
to die. A great, sad yearning seemed to split
his breast. He rose to his feet, his eyes upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
cloud. A turbulence now churned within him;
his shoulders palpitated within their cloth
prison (you see, they had not been sheared for a
full twenty-four hours); a wave of madness, of
daring, of revolt, rose into the head of Charles-Norton.
"No, no, no," he growled. "No more,
no more, I can't, I can't, no more, no, <i>no</i>!"</p>

<p>The last no was as a trumpet note&mdash;a defiant
negative hurled at the Force of the Universe.
And Charles-Norton began to race around the
fountain, striking with his right fist his left hand,
muttering unintelligible and tremendous protests.
You see, his wings had grown altogether
too long. He could feel their ligatures reaching
like roots to his soul. When, at the end of the
third lap, he came to his bench again, his mind
was made up. Only details remained to be determined.</p>

<p>And when he rose for the last time from the
bench, these were fixed. His appearance was one
of great calmness tense above a suppressed ebullition.
Before him his programme stretched like
a broad, clear road. He followed it.</p>

<p>Firstly he went to the bank and drew out three
hundred dollars in cash.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>With the roll in his breast-pocket, he walked
up Broadway till he came to a Cook's Tourist
agency; entering, after a short discussion aided
by the perusal of a map, he exchanged part of his
roll for a long, green, accordeon-pleated ticket.</p>

<p>Then he went out and bought himself a tawny,
creaky suit-case, and then, successively, going
from store to store:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Two collars.</p>

<p>A comb.</p>

<p>A neck-tie.</p>

<p>A tooth-brush.</p>

<p>A safety razor.</p>

<p>A little can of tooth-powder.</p>

<p>A shaving brush and a cake of soap.</p>

<p>A cap.</p>

<p>A pair of much abbreviated swimming trunks.</p>
</div>

<p>All of which he placed in his new suit-case.</p>

<p>Then after a moment of frowning consideration,
he purchased two thick woolen double-blankets
which he rolled up and strapped.</p>

<p>After which he boldly strode into the Waldorf-Astoria.</p>

<p>Such affluence, by this time, did his person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
emanate that four brass-buttoned boys simultaneously
sprang to their feet and came running
up to him. He waved them aside with a commanding
gesture and went into the writing-room.</p>

<p>He opened his check-book. "3," he wrote
firmly in the right hand corner. "Pay to the
order of," he read; "Dolly Margaret Sims," he
wrote, "Four hundred and eighty and no-hundredths
dollars."</p>

<p>He signed the check, tore it off, and let the
now looted check-book drop negligently to the
floor. He placed the folded check in an envelope,
wrote a little letter and placed it by the check,
sealed the envelope, and wrote upon it,</p>

<div class="signoff"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Charles Norton Sims</span><br />
<div class="signoff">267 West 129th St.<br />
<div class="signoff">New York<br />
</div></div></div>

<p>and rang for a messenger boy, to whom he gave
the letter.</p>

<p>Then calling for a taxi-cab, he whizzed away
to the Grand Central station.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, amid a ding-donging of bells
and a roaring of steam, a big, luxurious train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
began to strain at its couplings on its way overland.
As it slid slowly out beneath the resonant
cupola, Charles-Norton emerged from the
rear door and stepped out upon the observation
platform.</p>

<p>And there, upon this wide, large platform,
which was much like a miniature stage, Charles-Norton
appeared for a moment in undignified
pantomime. Leaning over the shining rail, chin
thrust out, he shook both fists at the receding
city, and spit into its face.</p>

<p class="cap">Charles-Norton's letter came to
Dolly in the evening, after a day full
of worry. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Dolly</span>

can't stand the life. I can't, that's all. I must
have, I must have&mdash;well, I can't stand that clipping
business any longer.</p>

<p>"Please don't grieve. Some day you'll meet a
man who is real fond of you and who will make
you happy&mdash;one that hasn't any wings. There
are lots of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>At the reading of this tactful epistle, Dolly,
of course, immediately burst out into hysterics.
These shall remain undescribed here. There is
something mysterious about hysteria which paralyzes
the pen. Not the least mysterious thing
about it is the fact that the word, pronounced in
an assembly of men and women, will simultaneously
call up haggard lines on the faces of the
men and cooing sniggles in the throats of the
ladies.</p>

<p>Anyway, poor little Dolly had it bad all that
night, and all the next day, and all the next night.
By the morning of the second day, it had passed
to a lamentable wandering to and fro within
the cage-like apartment, with disordered garments
and unkempt hair, through which eyes
shone with a glint of madness. By the afternoon
of the same day, it was taking some interest in
its reflection as it passed the several mirrors
in its ceaseless pacing. The reflection reminded
of Ophelia. Finally, when in the evening it
caught itself nibbling cracker and cheese in the
upset kitchen, it realized that it needed new stimulus.
It telegraphed for Dolly's Boston aunt.</p>

<p>The calculation proved correct. When, twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
hours later, the Boston aunt pressed the button
at the landing, she found herself almost immediately
tackled around the neck, while a shriek
pierced her right ear. This was followed by a
palpitant hugging, from the folds of which
emerged vague, bubbling sounds. The aunt bore
the demonstration with stoicism and with a certain
reservation of self. She was very much
unlike Dolly&mdash;tall and spare, with bushy brows,
beneath the deep arcade of which glowed two
limpid gray eyes. These eyes, during Dolly's
little performance, remained somehow outside of
the enveloping flutter. They peered over Dolly's
shoulder in an alert examination of the disorder
evident within the flat, and in their serene depths
a slight will-o'-the-wisp seemed discreetly dancing.
When finally Dolly's outburst had moderated,
the old lady spoke. "Where is the bath-room?"
she said.</p>

<p>Dolly dropped her convulsive hold and drew
back a step. "The bath-room!" she exclaimed,
her eyes very big; "you want to know where the
bath-room is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the bath," repeated Auntie, as though
astonished at the astonishment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>Dolly showed it to her. A calmness had come
over her, a calmness of indignation. Auntie gave
the bottom of the tub a hurried cleaning, adjusted
the faucet to a tepid flow, dropped in the stopper,
and sat down on the edge of the porcelain as
the water rose within. "I'm going to give you
a bath," she announced to Dolly, who stood there
petrified with hurt amazement.</p>

<p>And when the tub was full, she rose lightly to
her feet and began to take off Dolly's soiled
kimono. Dolly, in a daze, felt the garment slip
from her, and then slid into the warm, green pool,
which closed softly about her neck. "You lie
there a while," said Auntie; "I'll come back and
give you a shampoo."</p>

<p>And Dolly remained alone in the steaming
room. Little by little, to the persistent caress
of the warm water, she felt her body relax;
she shut her eyes; from beneath the closed lids
tears exuded softly; they came freely, without
a pang. After a while, even these ceased. From
the bedroom came the sound of a bed being
rolled, a flapping of sheets, a whirring of
blinds. Auntie returned. "Now," she said
alacriously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>Dolly's head was being rubbed; a snow-white
bubbly mountain was rising upon it, a mountain
like an island&mdash;that is to say, like that confection
known as a floating island; she could feel
on her scalp the wise, soothing fingers of her
aunt breaking down the resistance of her nerves;
her eyes, shut at first merely to keep out the
soap, remained closed in semi-ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Now, out you go!" suddenly boomed a voice,
as a patter of water descended upon her head;
and Dolly stepped out into the vigorous embrace
of a turkish towel. It was passing over
her body with a firm, rotary motion as of machinery;
she swayed within it like a palm in a
tempest. It slid up into her hair and finally
twisted itself about it in a turban. A fresh
night-dress descended about her; "to bed, now,"
said the voice.</p>

<p>The room was gray and cool within the lowered
blinds; passively, Dolly slipped in between the
fresh white sheets; her head sank into the crackling
pillow. A little sob rose in her throat.
"O, Auntie," she said, "O-o-o."</p>

<p>"Not a word now!" the capable lady immediately
broke in. "I know all about it. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
can tell it to me when you wake up. Go to sleep
now."</p>

<p>It was a pleasant sort of violence; as a harness
of flowers the obedience of Dolly's childhood
slipped again about her. She shut her eyes, then
like a puppy-dog snuggling to its mother, turned
and dug her round little nose into the pillow. A
snifflet of a sigh sounded&mdash;and as it sounded
became the first long breath of sleep.</p>

<p>The Boston aunt stood some time by the bed,
tall and straight like a grenadier on watch. Suddenly
she stooped down and placed a kiss upon
the curve of cheek emerging from the folds of
the pillow. Immediately she was erect again.
"Poor darned little girl!" she said.</p>

<p>She paused again, out in the dining-room, her
eyes far away. "<i>He</i> tried that once on me," she
said reminiscently. A gleam of humor lit up
her gray eyes. "I fixed him," she said decidedly.
And then, with some tenderness: "Poor great
big things," she said; "what chance have they
against us!"</p>

<p>Upon which she went into the kitchen where
lay a pile of viscous dishes, eloquent of the home's
demoralization.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>When Dolly emerged from her room some
twenty-four hours later, her face was pale and
her little nose was red, and she seemed a bit
dazed.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dolly," said the Boston aunt, looking
up and giving the sofa-cushion she was arranging
a final thump; "hello, Dolly; come into the
kitchen and have some breakfast."</p>

<p>Upon the gas stove she toasted bread and
poached two eggs, which she laid before Dolly
like two triumphant suns glowing through a fragrant
haze of coffee. Dolly successively suppressed
the joyous acclaim which instinctively
rose from her whole being at the sight; but she
ate. Rather mincingly, of course; but still, on
the whole, efficiently. At times she closed her
eyes, and then from beneath the lowered lids
a few tears came gliding without friction.
"Now," said the aunt, after the last crumb of
toast had disappeared; "let's go into the other
room and hear about it."</p>

<p>She led the way into that little room, which
was fairly encumbered with coziness. She took
one of the rocking-chairs. Dolly sank into the
other. By keeping the same rhythm, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
space for both to swing at the same time. Dolly
swayed back and forth three times, and then burst
into tears. "He has left me, Auntie; Goosie is
gone; ooh-ooh!" The aunt's chair ceased rocking
with an abruptness that made their knees
bump. Dolly's chair stopped; she looked at her
aunt in astonishment. Aunt Hester was sitting
up very straight. "Do you mean to say," she began,
and then paused as though unable to believe
the evidence; "do you mean to say," she went
on, "do you mean to say, Dolly Sims, that you
made me come down all the way from Boston
just because Charles-Norton is gone?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," answered Dolly, petrified. "Why,
yes. Isn't that enough; isn't it <i>enough</i>? My
life is ruined! Ruined! Oo-oo-ooh"&mdash;and her
eyes, ablaze for an instant, became veiled by a
filmy cascade.</p>

<p>"Pooh," said Aunt Hester, decidedly; "pooh.
Charles-Norton is gone; well, he'll come back."</p>

<p>"He's not coming back," wailed Dolly, indignantly;
"he's <i>not</i>! He has dee-s-s-er-ted me!"</p>

<p>"Deserted," jeered Aunt Hester. "Charles-Norton!
A fine chance Charles-Norton has to
desert you, Dolly! First of all, he couldn't make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
himself want to, no matter how much he tried.
And if he did want to, he couldn't. You wouldn't
let him, Dolly!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't let him! Oh! Do you think,
Auntie, that I am so low, so base, so devoid of
pride, as to keep a man who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Toot-toot," said Aunt Hester; "toot-toot&mdash;you
can't help it. Have you ever read that fellow
Darwin, Dolly?"</p>

<p>"Darwin," said Dolly, rather astonished at the
turn taken by the conversation; "Darwin&mdash;did
he write 'When Knighthood was in
Flower'?"</p>

<p>Aunt Hester opened her mouth like a fish suddenly
whisked out of water. She closed it again.
By the time she spoke, she had suppressed something.
"No, no, Dolly," she said. "<i>Darwin</i>,
the&mdash;well, it doesn't matter. We've been reading
him lately, anyway, at the Cooking Club. That
chap <i>knows</i> things, Dolly. He didn't tell me
anything I didn't know ahead myself; but he <i>explained</i>
lots of things I had found out. You
should read him."</p>

<p>"I'll read him, Auntie," said Dolly, with dolorous
voice. "I suppose I'll have to read now, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
paint china, or do something like that, now that
Charles, that Charles, that Charles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Charles, Charles, Charles," echoed Aunt
Hester, but in much different tone; "you'll get
your Charles back. Charles-Norton! He has
as much chance to escape you&mdash;as the earth has
to stop whirling around. You baby! Why,
you've got all Nature on your side, plotting and
scheming for you. <i>His</i> dice are loaded; he can't
win!"</p>

<p>"Aunty, what <i>are</i> you talking about! Here I
am, un-unhappy, and needing, needing, needing
friendship, and you sit and talk&mdash;I don't know
what."</p>

<p>"For, what is Charles-Norton?" continued the
Boston lady, as though she had not heard Dolly.
"What is Charles-Norton? A man. Hence, a
clung-to."</p>

<p>"A clung-to!" exclaimed Dolly, a dreadful
suspicion beginning to add itself to her greater
trouble.</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;a clung-to. And the direct heir of
hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands
of clung-tos. For of the men since the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of the world, Dolly, it's only the clung-tos
that survived, or rather that had babies that
survived&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Auntie!" admonished Dolly.</p>

<p>"Certainly," went on Aunt Hester, seemingly
misinterpreting Dolly's interruption. "They
alone had babies that survived. The babies of
the others&mdash;well, they starved, or fell into the
fire, or were massacred in the wars. So that
now there <i>are</i> no others. There are only descendants
of clung-tos, and hence clung-tos.
Charles-Norton, Dolly, is a clung-to!"</p>

<p>"But, Auntie," protested Dolly, "he isn't any
horrid such thing. And he's gone, he's gone&mdash;and
I certainly won't <i>force</i> him to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you, Dolly," pursued Aunt Hester, unruffled,
as though a professor addressing a group
of freshmen. "And you, Dolly, what are you?
A woman. Hence a cling-to."</p>

<p>"A cling-to!" screamed Dolly.</p>

<p>"Certainly. A cling-to. The end of a line
of thousands and thousands of cling-tos. For
of the women since the beginning of the world,
Dolly, which survived? The cling-tos. They
alone were able to live, and to have baby-girls
who survived&mdash;if cling-tos. The others, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
babies of the others, they starved; that's all,
Dolly, they starved. No mastodon steak for
them, Dolly; no nice wing-bone of ictiosaurus&mdash;they
starved. So that there are now no others&mdash;or
mighty few. You, Dolly, being alive and well
and a woman, are inevitably a cling-to."</p>

<p>"Auntie! Auntie!" murmured Dolly, puzzled
and horrified.</p>

<p>"To recapitulate," Aunt Hester swept on.
"To recapitulate: Charles-Norton is a clung-to;
you are a cling-to. Neither of you can help him
or herself. For it is the very essence of the
being of the one to hold, of the other to be
held."</p>

<p>"How horrible!" said Dolly, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"In other words, my dears," went on the aunt;
"in other words, you are <i>dreadfully</i> in love with
each other and can't keep apart."</p>

<p>"Love!" moaned Dolly.</p>

<p>"Love," the aunt repeated firmly.</p>

<p>Dolly rocked for a time; tears again were
dropping fast from the end of her eye-lashes.
"But he <i>doesn't</i> love me," she wailed at length.
"And he <i>isn't</i> a, a&mdash;that horrid Chinesy word you
call him, and he is gone, gone!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, my dear, of course," said Aunt Hester;
"of course, things are not quite as simple as
I have been describing them. A woman has to
use some sense about it these days. This clinging
business has become more complicated with
civilization. You may have erred in the details.
Now, tell me what has happened, all that has
happened."</p>

<p>And Dolly, in a rush of words, told the lamentable
story of her domestic woe, of her struggle
with the wings of Charles-Norton.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester was silent for a time; then she
nodded her head affirmatively. "Yes, that's it,
my dear," she said. "It is as I suspected. You
have been clinging with your eyes shut. And in
these perilous times it is necessary to cling with
eyes open. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Dolly had risen to her feet, vibrant. "Do
you mean to say," she began, and her voice was
very low and tense; "do you mean to say that I
should be subjected to living with a man&mdash;with
a man"&mdash;her voice rose&mdash;"with a man, Auntie,
who has <i>Wings</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" exclaimed Aunt Hester,
hastily, "you mistake me. Of <i>course</i>, I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
asking <i>that</i> of you. But that is not necessary
either. The essential&mdash;it is to let Charles-Norton
<i>believe</i> that he has his wings, not that he
should have them. And then, my dear, to be
frank, to be just, I must say that this seems
to me a case for compromise. Yes, dear, you
should allow Charles-Norton part of his wings;
oh yes, you should really let him have a bit of
these wings. And <i>that</i> bit, Dolly, if you are the
wise and capable little girl I think you can be,
you should turn to the advantage, to the preservation,
to the prosperity&mdash;hem&mdash;of the home!"</p>

<p>Dolly sat down, weak and trembling. She was
silent for a long time. When she spoke again,
it was in a tired voice. "Auntie," she said, "you
mean well. I know that you are trying to help
me and am very thankful to you. But we have
differing views of Life. I am willing to do much
for Charles-Norton&mdash;Oh, so much! I am willing
to meet him half-way, three-quarters of the way,
the whole way, on ever so many things, and I
have done so. But when it comes to a question,
Auntie, of self-respect, of morality, of <i>Decency</i>,
then, Auntie, never! On that, there can be no
compromise. Charles-Norton cannot have wings."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, very well," said Aunt Hester, plainly
nettled; "very well, very well. Then, what are
you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Dolly, decidedly. "I will give
him up," she said very firmly. "I will give him
up," she repeated grandiloquently. "I will give
him up," she said a third time&mdash;and broke out
weeping.</p>

<p>"That," said Aunt Hester, "is what is known
as the <i>grand stunt</i>, and is rather popular these
days. I've seen many try it, and mighty few
achieve it. And you, Dolly"&mdash;she rose and stood
with a hand upon the shaking shoulders beneath
her&mdash;"and you, you little soft Dolly, why, you
are about the last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not lift a finger," interrupted Dolly.
"If he, he, he does not love me, I, I shall, not
stoop to hold him!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Hester, briskly, "I am going
now. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Going!" cried Dolly, desolately.</p>

<p>"I am going," repeated Aunt Hester, firmly.
"There is nothing I can do here. And there're
Earl's socks to be looked after (he is just entering
Cambridge, you know), and Ethel's frocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
(she's at the High School), and then there is
your uncle&mdash;suppose he gets it into <i>his</i> head to
sprout feathers! No, no&mdash;I'm going home. <i>I'm</i>
willing to be what Nature said I had to be. <i>I</i>
don't take any chances with those new-fangled
grand-stunts. Besides, if you are just going to
do nothing, why, then, you can do that without
me."</p>

<p>And setting her bonnet upon her nice gray
hair, Aunt Hester picked up her grip and
marched out into the hall.</p>

<p>"Auntie! Auntie!" cried Dolly, running after
her.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester stopped at the opened door and
turned. She confronted Dolly, and the will-o'-the-wisp
was dancing in the profundities of her
deep-set eyes. A tenderness came into them; she
dropped her grip, seized Dolly, and drew her
close.</p>

<p>"Dear little Dolly," she whispered; "you'll do
it, don't you fear. You'll bring back your
Charles-Norton, you soft little woman, you;
you'll get him! And now, kiss me good-by.
Write to me&mdash;when you decide."</p>

<p>The door closed, and leaning against it, Dolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
wept a long time. Then she went within and in
a more comfortable position, wept more. She
wept for a whole week. And then, suddenly, one
afternoon, she stood up in the center of the room
and began stamping her foot.</p>

<p>"I won't," she said, with each stamp of the
little foot. "I won't, I won't, I won't!"</p>

<p>And saying "I won't," she did. She sat down
at the table and on her pale blue letter paper,
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Auntie</span>:&mdash;Yes, you were right, I guess.
I <i>am</i> a cling-to. I want him. I don't care:
he's mine and I <i>won't</i> give him up. Tell me how
to do it, Auntie, oh, tell me how! Quick, Auntie,
quick!"</p></div>

<p>The answer was not long in coming. "Dearest
Little Dolly," wrote Aunt Hester; "of course,
I knew you would, and I am glad. As to telling
you how&mdash;well, that is very simple. Just go to
him, Dolly. Go to him (not too soon; wait a
while) and just stick around. Your instincts
will tell you the rest. Rely on your instincts,
Dolly," went on this incorrigible Darwinian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"They are better than your reason, for they
are the reason of your mother and grandmother,
and all the line of mothers that came before you.
<i>They</i> had to be right, Dolly, or they wouldn't
have been, and then <i>you</i> wouldn't be. Go to
him, and stick around, and do as you feel like
doing. In all probability you'll be nice, and
humble, and snuggledy, and warm. And then,
make&mdash;your arrangements. <i>He</i> can't help himself.
Nature is on your side. His dice are
loaded. Cling, Dolly, cling."</p>

<p>Dolly blushed. "Auntie is horrid," she said.
And then, after a while, "But right," she said.</p>

<p class="cap">Meanwhile, unaware of this discussion
and of this decision, Charles-Norton, inflated
with fancied freedom, captain of
his soul and master of his Fate, was having a
beautiful time.</p>

<p>Tableau:</p>

<p>A meadow by a lake, on the western slope of
a high Sierra.</p>

<p>Below, and far to the west, lies a great plain,
liquid with distance as though it were a sea of
gold. From its nearer edge, the land comes leaping
up in wide smooth waves of serried pines, to
the meadow. There the pines stop abruptly, in
the leaning immobility of a man who has almost
trodden upon a flower. From their feet the
meadow spreads, fresh and lush, susurant with
the hidden flow of a brook, and jeweled here
and there with flowers that are like butterflies.
It stops, in its turn, before a chute of smooth
granite in the form of a bowl. In the curve of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the bowl lies a lake&mdash;a silvery lake in the depths
of which dark blue hues pulse, and over the face
of which light zephyrs pass, like painted shivers.</p>

<p>On the other side of the lake, to the east,
the land continues to rise, in accelerated assault,
first in long lustrous leaps of glacier-polished
granite, then in a chaos of dome and spire, and
finally breaks up against the sky in a serrated
edge like the top-crest of a great wind-flagellated
wave which, attacking Heaven, should have been
suddenly petrified by a Word.</p>

<p>On the border of the pine-forest, its one door
upon the meadow and facing the lake, is a log-cabin.</p>

<p>It is early morning, and the air is crisp and
cold. To the left of the cabin, in the dusk of
the trees, a fuzzy little donkey stands immobile
as if still frozen by the night.</p>

<p>The sun, still behind the high crest to the
east, aureoles it with rose; its light passes in a
broad sheet athwart the sky, leaving the meadow
in a lower darkish plane, as if in the still half-light
of a profound sea; it strikes here and there,
among the pinnacles, a glacier that scintillates
frigidly. To the west, above the plain, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
as yet but an opalescent gray shift, the last star
hangs humidly, like a tear at the end of a lash.</p>

<p>The rose halo deepens along the mountain
top; the dark-blue dome of the sky fills with a
lighter azure; the star swoons, and the sun peers
over the crest. It ascends. Its rays plunge into
the pool of darkness still upon the meadow; they
pierce it, at first separately as with rapier
thrusts, and then finally billow down into it in a
cascade of molten gold. The shadows flee; the
sunlight strikes the cabin; and Charles-Norton
Sims appears at the door.</p>

<p>Immediately, the little donkey, rousing to life,
comes braying to him across the green. Charles-Norton
gives him a handful of salt, and with a
slap sends him off again.</p>

<p>And then he stands in the door-way with arms
folded, facing the sun. He is nude&mdash;except for
the abbreviated swimming-trunks which were his
last buy in New York&mdash;and to the light his skin,
polished like ivory, takes on a warm and subtle
glow. From his shoulders there hangs behind
him, to his heels, something that might be a cloak,
except that it does not cloak him. It does not
envelop him; rather does it stand behind him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
in ornamental background, with a certain sculptural
effect. And it is white, a wondrous gleaming
white, against which the whiteness of his
skin seems rosy. Starting from his shoulders,
it goes out and up in gentle undulation to either
side, and then descends in two swift slight curves
that meet in a gothic tip at his heels. It is in
shape like a Greek urn, but has with it a flowing
quality&mdash;and the whiteness. It is like a Greek
urn of pure alabaster that would have turned
liquid, and would be pouring down behind him
in lustrous cascade.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton steps forward&mdash;and suddenly
this background, this mantle, this singular ornament,
parts in two glistening sections which rise
horizontally to either side of him. By Jove, they
are wings! The wings of Charles-Norton. They
have been growing, since that <i>coup-de-tête</i> of
his.</p>

<p>He raises them horizontally, and with a dry
rustling sound they open out like fans. He
waves them gently, up and down; his chest fills,
his head goes back; and from his open mouth, as
from a clarion, there goes out a great clear cry
which, striking the mountain, rebounds along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
from rock to rock in golden echoes. He rises into
the air.</p>

<p>He goes up slowly, in wide, negligent circles,
with slow, strong flap of wings, his body, with
pointed feet close together, hanging lithe, a warm
ivory white between the colder and more radiant
whiteness of the wings. He turns and floats
above the lake, then, folding his wings, like a
white arrow shoots down into the water. A fountain
of foaming drops springs toward the sky.
Charles-Norton Sims is having his morning
bath.</p>

<p>He swims with smooth breast-stroke, his feet
and hands below the water, but his wings raised
above. Their roots, at his shoulders, cleave the
glazed surface like a prow, leaving, behind, a
slender wake; they follow above, swinging a
bit from side to side, like glorious becalmed
sails.</p>

<p>And thus, like a large Nautilus, he drifts to
the shore. He emerges, glistening, upon a little
beach which curves there like a little moon
dropped by a careless Creator; he takes a hop,
a skip, and a jump, and lands headlong upon the
yellow sand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>He stretches himself taut, his hands, straight
above him, clutching the sand, his toes digging
into it, and spreads his wings in fans at his sides.
The earth is there beneath him, in his embrace;
he feels her strength flowing into his veins. The
sun is up there, above him; he feels pouring upon
him, penetratingly, its hot life. Content croons
in his heart.</p>

<p>But after a while, an uneasiness stirs him. He
moves vaguely several times, he finally rises to
his knees. Oh yes, of course, it is his stomach&mdash;the
old tyranny. He walks to the cabin, kicks
into incandescence the heap of coals in front of
the door, and throws a handful of dry brush upon
them. He seizes a long pole which is leaning
against the façade of the cabin, goes back to the
lake, climbs a large bowlder, and sitting himself
comfortably in a hollow of it, extends the pole,
and drops into the crystalline waters at his feet a
bit of red flannel. Immediately there is a small
convulsion and he whisks out of the lake a
vibrant little object that looks like a fragment of
rainbow. He whisks out another, another&mdash;twelve
in succession. He goes back to the fire
with his rainbows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>There, he&mdash;fries them; and&mdash;eats them.</p>

<p>Upon which he squats contentedly upon the
grass, and fills and lights his pipe. He sits there
very quietly, his feet drawn up, his wings behind
him like a resplendent mantle; he smokes gravely
his little black pipe. His eyes are half-closed,
watching the hazy blue puffs of the bowl rise toward
the turquoise-blue dome of the sky. Far
above him, a hawk is circling; to the sight, after
a while, a vague melancholy enters his heart, a
subtle and inexplicable yearning. He rises
slowly to it, his pipe dropping from his loosened
lips. He tucks the pipe into his trunks (that is
why he wears the trunks); his wings spread out
to both sides. He gives a little spring&mdash;and is up
in the air.</p>

<p>He hovers above the meadow a while, a bit
aimlessly, as though waiting for an inspiration,
rising, falling, rising with slow strong flap of
wing&mdash;then suddenly he is off, like a streak, in a
whirring diagonal for the high crests. He
dwindles, higher and higher, farther and farther,
smaller and smaller, till finally he is among the
tip-top pinnacles, a mere white palpitation, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
snow-flake in the whirl of a capricious wind, a little
glistening moth flitting from glacier to glacier
as from lily to lily.</p>

<p>Down in the deserted meadow, the little donkey
opens his mouth creakingly, and throws forth a
lonesome bray.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">This is what Charles-Norton Sims is doing
while his little wife, back in New York,
sits desolate in her empty flat.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of his flight, sitting at the
wide window of a Pullman which was clicking
slowly along a high summit, he had caught between
two snow-sheds a rapid glimpse of this
nook in the chaos of the World. In a picture
flashed clear for a moment to his eyes, he had seen
the cabin, the meadow, and the lake; and his
heart had given a leap like that of the anchor of a
ship which at last has come to port. When, thirty
minutes later, the train, now on the down-grade,
had slid with set brakes by a little mining-camp
huddled at the foot of a great red scar torn in the
heart of a slanting pine forest, Charles-Norton,
without more ado, had seized his grip and his
blankets, and sidling out to the platform, had
jumped lightly and neatly to the ground.</p>

<p>When the last gleaming rail of the train had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
vanished around a bend, Charles-Norton descended
to the camp. It was a decrepit camp,
the mine having given out. Charles-Norton
found the whole population in the general store.
It consisted of five men, about which seemed
thrown an invisible but heavy cloak of somnolence.
They had entered languidly but politely
into his plans. The storekeeper had gladly
parted with one-third of the comestible stock
which was slowly petrifying on shelf and rafter;
a little burro, grazing on the dump, had been
transformed into a pack-animal; and after
standing treat three times around, Charles-Norton,
leading by a rope his fuzzy four-footed companion,
to a great flapping of amicable sombreros
had taken the trail winding toward the
high hills.</p>

<p>The little burro, now obscurely melancholic,
grazed in the meadow. Within the cabin, depending
from the smoke-polished rafters, a sack of
flour, a bag of sugar, a ham, and several sides of
bacon were strung, while a pyramid of tins
leaned against the blackened fireplace. The bunk
against the right wall held Charles-Norton's
blankets; the one on the left wall was empty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>In spite of this empty bunk, which at times
yawned with an air of vague reproach, the cabin,
with its wide fireplace, in the center of which a
rotund kettle hung, with its neatly strung and
stacked provisions, had a certain coziness, a
sober, sedate expression of assurance for days to
come.</p>

<p>And it was a fine life to live.</p>

<p>He would get up early in the morning, and
reached the sill of the door with the sun. He
would have his swim, his breakfast, and his
smoke&mdash;and then he was off.</p>

<p>He was off for an all-day winged romp. He
made straight for the crest at first and lit upon
the tip-top of its highest pinnacle, rising there
out of the rocky chaos like an exclamation of
gleaming granite. Its top, hollowed by the
weathers, made a seat which just fitted him. To
the north and to the south, the saw-toothed crest
extended for miles to purple disappearances;
within its folds, here and there, a glacier scintillated
like a jewel. To the west and to the east,
the mountain descended; at first in a cataract of
polished domes and runs, then in long velvety
waves of stirring pines, and finally in pale-yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
foothills, to the plains. These were very far and
were elusive of aspect. Sometimes they were as
a haze; sometimes like a carpet of twined flowers
upon a slowly heaving sea; sometimes they
were liquid, and then the one to the east was
bluishly white, like milk, the one to the west like
pooled molten gold.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton sat here long, his elbow on his
knees, his chin in his hand, his wings drooping behind,
along the perpendicular smoothness of the
rock, and pondered his happiness. A profound
satisfaction was within him; it was as if his
blood, at last, were flowing submissively along a
great cosmic stream, to some eternal behest.
After a time, he rose a-tip-toe, like a diver above
a gleaming sheet, extended his wings, and
sprang.</p>

<p>At first he dropped plumb, into the abyss; then
his spread wings caught the air and held his fall.
He gave one soft flap, and then another, and rose.
He floated upward; he was even with the top of
the pinnacle, passed it slowly, saw it beneath his
feet, and still, with slow, strong beat of wing,
continued ascending. It was joyous work; he
rose on powerful pinion; it was as if his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and shoulders continuously were emerging from
one layer of the atmosphere into another
more fresh and clear and more beautiful; the
air streamed along his skin in a clean, cold
caress that enveloped his soul. He passed big
sad eagles that flew with lowered beaks, their
wrinkled and worried eyes upon the peaks below;
he laughed, and astounded, they fell off beneath
him in vertiginous circles. The earth beneath
was like a bowl, a bowl full of plashing sunshine.
He kept on up, rising straight in the cold
and hollow air, into a great silence, the only
sound that of his wings, beating a solemn measure.
He looked no longer down, now. Head
rearing back, face to the sun, with half-closed
eyes he went on up with outspread wings, an
ecstasy clutching at his heart; clutching at it,
clutching at it, till finally it was too exquisite
to bear, and half-swooning, with dangling pinion
he let himself swoop back through the dizzy
spaces, back to the earth.</p>

<p>Again upon his pinnacle, he lay very still,
long, on his back, breathing deeply, while slowly
the ecstatic languor left his body. He was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
little afraid of this game, this perpendicular assault
of infinities, and allowed it to himself only
once a day. It was his dissipation; there was
something vaguely perilous in the absorption of
it. So, having rested now, he betook himself to
less audacious pastimes.</p>

<p>He selected a peak some ten miles away, and
shot to it in a line which was impeccably straight.
Then he repeated the flight, this time in a slight
even curve, flowing and smooth as the rise, swell,
and gradual fall of a musical chord. The next
time, he flew to the peak in a zipping parabola
that was as the course of a rocket.</p>

<p>This game was the consummation of the old
yearning which, in days gone by, had impelled
him to draw lines upon a sheet of paper. Where
before, miserably and inadequately, tormented
by a sense of impotence, he had drawn with a
pencil lines upon paper, he now drew, with his
whole gleaming white body, stupendous lines of
beauty upon the blue of the sky.</p>

<p>He liked this. He sensed his evolution. He
seemed to have within his brain a delicate instrument
that recorded the movements of his body.
As he cut through the azure, each flown line was
deposited within him in a record of beauty. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
flew from peak to peak, in lean, sizzling white
lines; in shooting diagonals; in gentle floating
curves; in zig-zags as of lightning; in rising and
drooping lines that hoped and despaired; in soarings
that aspired and broke; in arabesques that
laughed; in gothic arches that prayed; in large
undulations that wept. Sometimes he drew
whole edifices&mdash;fairy castles, domes, towers,
spires&mdash;which, once created, went floating off forever
on the blue, freighted with their fantastic
inhabitants, invisible, impalpable, and imperishable.
And always within him was the record of
the created thing, the record of created beauty,
etched forever in the inner chamber of his soul.</p>

<p>Sometimes he played with his shadow; he tried
to lose it. With a sudden bound that was meant
to take it unaware, he was off, along the crest, at
vertiginous speed. He went on thus, mile after
mile; mile after mile, razing the peaks, he passed
along the crest like a white thunderbolt, his
wings a blur, his body streaming behind like an
arrow. His head struck the air, broke it, parted
it; it slid along his flanks in a caress that penetrated
to his heart. But always beneath him,
like a menace in water-depths, springing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
peak to peak in huge flaccid leaps, stubborn and
black his shadow followed him.</p>

<p>Of all the lines he knew, however, the one that
he loved best was the one he drew when returning
to the cabin at sunset. He would come to
the meadow from the mountains at a high
altitude, and then, placing himself carefully
above it, he would fold his wings and drop.</p>

<p>He shot down like an arrow, in a long palpitant
line, and then, two hundred yards from
the sward, opened his wings in an explosion of
fluffy whiteness.</p>

<p>Out of this line he obtained a profound sensation
of beauty, of beauty in simplicity. It was
as though he had drawn a long, slender stalk
that opened in a white chalice; as though he had
planted a flower, a cosmic flower, there in the
bosom of the sky.</p>

<p>In the evening, after his meal and his pipe, he
winged away to a last adventure which was as a
prayer. Leaving the warm glow of his camp-fire,
he soared upward into the violet night. The
earth fell away beneath him, a blue blur, a
shadow, till finally the shadow itself whelmed in
nocturnal profundities, and of the earth there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
remained nothing but the little fire, the little
fire gleaming red in the clearing. He rose. The
night accepted him with silence and solemnity,
in a velvety envelopment. He rose. The stars,
at first, were all above him; gradually new cohorts
of them appeared to his right and his left,
on all sides; and finally, his fire, down in the
clearing, itself become a star, closed a perfect
sphere. He was the center of a universe of stars;
the soft beating of his wings was as the hushed
tolling of their eternities; the rustle of his wings
the crackling of their flames. They moved as
he moved; always their center, he could not approach
them. And thus encircled, sometimes
bewildered, he lost his way. He forgot which
star was his; seized with sudden fright, he
winged one way and another in mad dashes toward
cold orbs which fled him.</p>

<p>But always, finally remembering, he could
find his way merely by folding his wings.</p>

<p>He folded his wings, and immediately, of all
the stars the little winking red one came rushing
to him while the others slid by. It came
rushing to him fiercely, with a sort of jealous and
almost ludicrous haste, its face red with effort.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>And with it came the earth, a shadow, a fragrance;
its warm, sweet breath fanned his cheek.
Spreading largely his wings, he lit softly upon
the meadow-grass, by the little fire, by the cabin,
home for the night.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Man changes. Toward the end of summer,
Charles-Norton found himself insensibly
altering the glorious routine of his altitudinous
existence.</p>

<p>One day he was tempted by the great plain
that lay golden in the West. Idly, he let himself
float down the mountain sides, in long descending
diagonals, and suddenly found himself above
a farm in the plain. In the backyard, children
were playing; a man was sharpening a plowshare
at a wheel, and out of the kitchen-shed
there came a clatter of dishes and the voice of
a woman in song. Seized by a sudden perverse
humor, Charles-Norton swooped into the chicken-yard
and snatched a hen which, feeling herself
rising in his hand, straightway shut her eyes and
died of imagination. A scream rose from the
earth, and looking down, Charles-Norton saw the
three little children, legs apart, hands behind
them, gazing up with white eyes; the man, back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to the wheel, had his mouth open, as if inviting
his vanishing fowl to drop back into it; and out
of the kitchen door a wide woman suddenly
popped, her lips working in malediction. His
amusement a bit dampened by this consternation
and by the unforeseen conduct of the hen,
Charles-Norton went winging back, the dead fowl
dangling at the end of his arm, to his retreat, and
that night, when the pangs of his conscience had
somewhat moderated, enjoyed the best dinner he
had had for many days.</p>

<p>This incident reawakened in Charles-Norton
a certain interest in human-kind. He began to
visit the Valley more often.</p>

<p>The Valley was some hundred miles south of
his meadow. It was a great cleft that split the
mountain range from crest to center. Its walls
were perpendicular and glacier-polished, and
sculptured at the top into smooth domes and
fretted spires. Down these sheer walls, here and
there, coming to them without suspicion, whole
rivers fell&mdash;some in rockets of diamonds, others
chastely, in thin flight, like shifting and impalpable
veils, others in great lustrous columns
that struck the rocky bottom with thunderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
impact and rebounded high in clouds of pulverized
silver.</p>

<p>The Valley seemed full of people. They came
in from the West, in stages. They lived in a
large structure, at the bottom, which Charles-Norton
surmised to be a hotel, and hundreds
camped along the banks of the river, which
wound light-green through the dark-green
meadows. They wandered about incessantly,
like ants; most of the time, at the bottom, but a
good deal of the time also along the vertical
sides, toiling pantingly up narrow trails, laid
like the coils of a riata, till they reached points
of vantage&mdash;domes, pinnacles, heads of falls&mdash;whereupon
they immediately sat down and devoured
sandwiches.</p>

<p>When Charles-Norton had first discovered the
Valley, he had fled from it at the sight of human
beings. But now, often, a secret impulse urged
him to it. He spent days there, crouching upon
the top curve of a great half-dome from which
he could look down and watch the little beings
at their lives&mdash;walking about, cooking their
meals, eating them, or following the arduous
windings of the trails with sweating noses. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
night their fires twinkled red; and once, when
Charles-Norton, wrapped in the secrecy of the
dark, had slowly floated the whole length of the
Valley above them, there had come to him, softened
and blended by distance, the harmony of
their voices in song.</p>

<p>At first, he had felt but disdain for them, but
gradually another feeling had come to him, they
were so slow, and crawly, and helpless&mdash;and yet
so indomitable. A vague pity, almost a respect,
swelled within him as he watched them panting,
and perspiring, and toiling up the slopes, reaching
thus with untold effort heights insignificant
to him, from which they presently tumbled down
again after their inevitable lunch of sandwiches.
This new interest expressed itself rudimentarily
in a perverse desire to tease them. Yielding to it
one afternoon, in broad daylight he sailed the
whole length of the Valley, going slowly, resplendent
in the sun. He could see the little beings
gather in groups, and see the little yellow
faces screwed up toward him; and upon the stage,
gliding in from the West like a Cinderella coach
drawn by six white mice, all the passengers were
standing with milling arms. With a few strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
beats, he whizzed out of range and returned to
his meadow, chuckling.</p>

<p>He was back again the next day, though, and
the next; and of evenings he began to hover about
the Upper Inn.</p>

<p>The Upper Inn was a little chalet built
on the edge of the Valley's northern wall. It
crouched there, small as a toy in the chaos of
huge domes surrounding it, backed up against a
great granite-rooted tamarack as if in fear of the
abyss yawning at its feet. From its veranda,
a glance fell sheer, along the glacier-polished
wall, to the valley floor, three thousand feet
below.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, of evenings, liked to hover in
the void in front of the Inn, his head even with
the veranda, his body dangling beneath, while
he looked through the glass door into the hall
within.... Always a red fire glowed there,
within a large black fireplace; and about it, men
and women, in garments fresh and clean after
the day's climbing, sat chatting or reading.
Among them was a young woman who interested
Charles-Norton. She was slim and very fair,
with hair that lay light upon her head as a golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
vapor, and she wore upon her shoulders, negligently
draped, a scarf within the white shimmer
of which a color glowed like a flame. Beside
her nearly always hovered a big young fellow,
dark and handsome, but who did not seem very
happy.</p>

<p>One evening she rose abruptly, and before
Charles-Norton could guess her intention, she
had opened the door, and was out upon the veranda,
gazing toward him with eyes yet blind
with the darkness. Charles-Norton did not
move. They two remained thus long, she looking
straight out into the void, divining perhaps&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;a vague palpitant whiteness, like a
soul, out there in the night; he, moving his
great wings slowly and softly, while his heart
within him thumped loud. Then he let himself
sink silently, till beneath the plane of the Inn's
floor, circled, and rising again, took a position
at the end of the veranda, from which, peering
around the corner of the house, he could still observe
her.</p>

<p>She stood there, tight against the rail, as
though she had brought up abruptly against it,
making impetuously for the void. He could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
her slight pliant form, silhouetted against the
jeweled horizon; upon her shoulders, her scarf
floated like a vague phosphorescence, and her face
was whitely turned toward the stars. He heard
her take a long deep breath of the night, and
then her arms went up and out in a vibrant
gesture.</p>

<p>She remained thus, a long moment, her eyes toward
the stars, her arms toward the stars, and her
whole slender body, arched slightly backward,
seemed to offer itself to the stars. Then suddenly
her head dropped, her arms dropped, and
she straightened, leaning against the rail. The
door behind had opened and closed again, and
upon the veranda, now, was the big loom of another
form, a form which carried, at the height
of the head, a warm pulsing glow, like the incandescent
point of a red-heated poker.</p>

<p>They stood immobile, the two, a long time.
She had not stirred since her first start; she remained
with her back to the door, her eyes out
into the void. Then the point of light on the
larger form slid down, till it dangled at the end of
what Charles-Norton guessed was an arm, and a
low voice toned in the silence. "Why did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
leave me?" he said; "why do you always leave
me?"</p>

<p>Her voice answered immediately, clear and
warm as a red crystal. "Oh, I wanted to say
good-by to the stars," she said; "I wanted to say
good-by to the stars!"</p>

<p>"And why did you want to say good-by to the
stars?" he asked, speaking softly, as to a child.</p>

<p>"Because," she said, "I am leaving them. Because
I am leaving the stars."</p>

<p>"And why are you leaving the stars?" he
asked, taking a step toward her.</p>

<p>She turned toward him, now, and laid both her
hands lightly upon his shoulders. "Because,
John, I am going to you," she said; "because,
John, I love you."</p>

<p>"Dora!" he cried.</p>

<p>She arrested him with a gesture. "I have
loved you long, John," she went on; "I have
loved you long&mdash;but I have fought it, fought it,
fought it, John!"</p>

<p>"And why have you fought it?" he asked,
again gently, as to a child.</p>

<p>"Because, John&mdash;oh, I don't know. Because,
John, there is something within me&mdash;which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
don't know. Something which yearns, John&mdash;for
I don't know what. For peaks, John, for skies,
for the stars; for&mdash;I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dora, Dora," he said, a bit sadly.</p>

<p>"And so I fought it, John, I fought your love.
But it has poured into me, John, as honey fills a
chalice; gradually, sweetly, it has filled my veins,
my blood, my heart, John. And to-night, John,
my whole being was swollen with it, John, with
the love of you, John, and I came out to say
good-by to the stars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dora!" he cried again; and this time enveloped
her in his arms.</p>

<p>A horrid, impish feeling suddenly pricked
Charles-Norton; taking wing he slid along the
veranda and seized, as he passed, from the
shoulders of the girl, the scarf, from the conceited
head of the young man, his derby hat, and flapped
off with them in the darkness. The crash of an
astonished chair and a faint little cry followed
him for a moment, then dropped off behind.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton laughed all the way home.
Half-way over he dropped, into the deepest abyss
he knew, the derby hat, which arrived at the bottom,
no doubt, in very bad condition. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
scarf was still with him as he alighted in the
meadow and felt against his hand the humid
greeting of Nicodemus, the lonely little donkey.</p>

<p>Across the cabin, as he went to sleep, the
empty bunk yawned, somehow, with unusual insistence.
"I wonder what Dolly is doing," he
said vaguely, as he slid down the slumber-chute.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Dolly was getting along very well, thank
you. Mostly, she was reading the papers.
For if Charles-Norton thought for a moment
that his indiscretions were to go unrecorded,
he was very much mistaken.</p>

<p>Cuddled in the big Morris chair of the little
flat, a be-ribboned sack loose about her comfortable
little body, her head golden in the soft cascade
of light falling from the lamp, an open box
of candy at her elbow, Dolly was reading the
evening paper. It was all about Charles-Norton
Sims, the paper, though it did not mention him
by name, but variously, according to the temperaments
of its correspondents, as a condor, an ichthyosaurus,
the moon, an aeroplane, a Japanese
fleet, a myth, a cloud, a hallucination, a balloon,
and a goose. As she read, she alternately frowned
and laughed. Her brows would draw together
very seriously, and then suddenly her red lips
would part to let through a sparkling rocket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
laughter, and then her brows would again knit in
concern. The laughter was of triumph at seeing
her prophecy come true, for of course, all the
time, she had known that Charles-Norton, left
alone, would make a fool of himself; the concern
was at the thought that, still alone, he would
continue to make a fool of himself.</p>

<p>"Well," she said finally, as the paper slipped
from her knees to the floor; "well, it's about
time I rescued the poor dear. I must go to
him."</p>

<p>She sat gazing mentally back over the lonely
two months, the period of her existence now
about to terminate, and was astonished to find
that, after all, it had not been so bad. Ever
since the first crisis, ever since she had made
up her mind to hold on to Charles-Norton, the
worst, somehow, had been over. It had seemed
as if, that determination once made, there was
little left to worry over, that things could not
possibly come out wrong, that the cosmos itself
was with her. And so, she had not worried.
And she had had a pretty good time; a pretty
good time. Better, in fact, in some ways
than&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sh-sh-sh," she hissed, stilling the thought.</p>

<p>But why was that?</p>

<p>Well, first of all, there had been the engrossing
mystery of the spring hat; this, followed by the
still more exciting problem of the summer hat;
and now she was planning for the fall hat&mdash;she
had seen the cutest feathery toque, that came
low down about her face, pushing to all sides
little wisps of golden curls and making her look&mdash;well,
very nice indeed. Then, of course, there
had been less housework, and she had had much
more time to herself, more time and more freedom.
The acquaintance with Flossie, the young
wife of the floor-walker in the flat across the
landing, had helped a lot. Together they had
plunged deep into the intoxication of the shops.
And several times they had gone off, a bit defiantly,
on little orgies. They would go to the
matinee, and then have a chocolate ice-cream soda
at Huyler's, and called that "having a fling."
All this, of course, had been impossible when
Charles-Norton had been about. But why? Oh,
because he worked so hard, and there wasn't
much, there wasn't so much&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Dolly paused and blushed. "Oh, that money,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
she said deprecatingly; "that horrid, horrid
mon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet to a sudden new thought
and went into her room, where from beneath ribbons,
stockings, gloves, and theater-programmes,
she drew out of a drawer a little yellow book and
a longer, more narrow, green one.</p>

<p>When she returned, she was a bit pale, and
sank rather limply into her chair. "Ooh," she
exclaimed disconsolately; "ooh, now I've <i>got</i> to
get to him; get to him <i>soon</i>!"</p>

<p>Go to him. But where&mdash;how&mdash;where?</p>

<p>She knew where he was now, it is true&mdash;but
only relatively. The first report of his antics
had come from a little town in the California
foothills; the second from a summer resort in a
Valley of the Californian Sierra. He was being
reported pretty well all over the United States
now, but the first news in all probability were the
only valuable clew. They were desolately vague
though. A man who flies covers much ground.
Where did he sleep? Where was his lair&mdash;or his
nest, rather? It was sleeping, not flying, that
he was to be caught. How could she locate him?
It would take time, to do this, and money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>And the check-book&mdash;oh, Lordie, that check-book!</p>

<p>Little Dolly, always at the bottom a pretty
level-headed creature, had become wonderfully
patient in the past month. Patient with a determination
fixed as a star, as a law of Nature; a
determination which was stronger far than herself;
which was outside herself; which she could
feel, almost, a huge pressure behind her, as of
great reservoirs filled through trickling æons;
and which astonished her. She had written of
it, once, to her aunt.</p>

<p>"Dear Dolly," had answered this Darwinian
lady; "you are right. It is not of you. It is of
all women that have gone before you, of the millions
and millions of women who have fought,
and plotted, and intrigued in order to keep alive
the spark of Life and hand it down to you. It is,
Dolly, the Persistence of Woman; the inexorable
persistence of Woman, Dolly, holding Man.
Holding Man, Dolly, in spite of his superior
physical strength, of his superior brutality; holding
him through the ages. The terrific persistence
of Woman holding Man, Dolly, Man&mdash;the
restless, the moody, the incomprehensible; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
erratic one, ever dissatisfied, ever bounding to
the end of his chain in blind surges toward
painted things of the air which <i>we</i> know do not
exist.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; you cannot help it, dear little Dolly.
Cling, Dolly, cling!"</p>

<p>"That's horrid," Dolly had said, when she had
finished this epistle.</p>

<p>And then, after a while, but this time with a
smile; "how <i>perfectly</i> horrid!"</p>

<p>But now, this patience, this persistence, was
indeed a precious thing. It enabled her to wait
calmly for the turn of chance which would enable
her to find Charles-Norton. She read the
papers every day. Truth to tell, they promised
little help, for by this time they were announcing
Charles-Norton simultaneously in New Orleans,
Quebec, Key West, and Victoria. Wisely, Dolly
had preserved the first clippings. And after all,
it was from the papers that was to come the
solution. The paper, one morning, after describing
appearances of Charles-Norton in Vladivostock,
Paris, and Timbuctoo, had slid from her
knees to the floor, when her eyes lit upon an advertisement
on the up-turned back-page.</p>

<p>"Ooh!" said Dolly, suddenly clapping both
her hands to her heart; "ooh, I've got it!"</p>

<p>She sat there, a little weak with excitement,
while a rosiness came to her cheeks and a light in
her eyes. "Yes," she said at length; "yes;
that's it!"</p>

<p>Upon which she dressed very carefully, put on
her hat, and went downtown to the Hippodrome.</p>

<p>Once there, she hesitated a moment before the
glazed-glass door with its shining brass plate,
then knocked like a little mouse. A big bass
voice told her to come in.</p>

<p>The owner of the voice was seated at the desk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
leaning back in his rolling-chair, a big firecracker
of a cigar in the corner of his mouth.
His feet were on the desk, and Dolly noticed them
first: they were encased in high-heeled boots that
seemed very soft and fitted like gloves. A soft,
wide-brimmed felt hat sat rakishly upon his head.
Hat, cigar, and boots dropped to a simultaneous
disappearance. The man rose, and Dolly saw
that his hair was very white and long, and cascaded
in curls to his shoulders; and that, what
with this hair, the little white goatee at the
end of his chin, and the long rapier-like mustachios,
of the same color, upon his upper lip, he
looked like a French musketeer of the seventeenth
century. He bowed, sweepingly. Now he was
like a Spanish grandee. But the little eyes beneath
his bushy eyebrows were blue and shrewd.</p>

<p>Recovering from her first movement of surprise,
Dolly made straight for the desk, her eyes
set, her lips firm. "Mr. Bison Billiam?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He bowed again in assent. "And at your service,
madam," he said, and bent his head down
toward her in courteous attention.</p>

<p>But at the first rush of words from her, an
agitation came over him; his shrewd little eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
flitted here and there about the room as though
suspicious. He stopped her with a wide gesture.
"Sh-sh," he hissed gently; "this is very important
indeed; we must not be overheard. Won't
you step into my private office. Do me this
favor," he asked, opening a heavily-paneled door
behind him.</p>

<p>Dolly had a glimpse of a broad polished mahogany
table, of heavy chairs. She went in; he
followed her; the door closed.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, she stood again at the
outer door, Bison Billiam, knob in hand, arching
above her in deferential leave-taking. "I will see
to everything," he assured her; "everything.
This is certainly most worthy of being looked
into. And I shall do it myself. Myself," he
repeated, emphasizing the two little syllables as
though that fact were of tremendous importance;
"myself." He bowed again, to the ground. The
door closed.</p>

<p>Dolly, alone on the landing, suddenly slid the
length of the hall in an airy jig. "Oh," she said,
"we're going to be rich. I'll have a butler; and
things!"</p>

<p>"Clang!" went the elevator, stopping at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
floor. Dolly abruptly became again a very dignified
little lady. Once out on the street, however,
she went straightway to the milliner's,
where she purchased almost with the last of her
bank account the coveted fall hat. It was a
furry toque, with a white aigrette; it came down
to her ears and made her look like a little
Cossack.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">On the other side of the continent, Charles-Norton's
retreat began to be haunted.</p>

<p>He was taking his flight above the lake,
one morning, in the cool gold of sunrise, when
suddenly a suspicion, a vague sensing of peril,
passed like a cloud between him and the light.
Immediately he let himself eddy to the beach, and
there, stretched low along the sand, with craning
neck he peered carefully about him.</p>

<p>At first he could see nothing. Twice he half
rose to resume his flight, but each time flattened
out again to the same subtle sense of presence.
And at last, with a thump of his heart, he saw
him&mdash;on the edge of the meadow, a man upon a
horse, in the dusk of the pines.</p>

<p>They stood there, man and beast, framed by the
pines, immobile and silent. The horse was a
beautiful silken white, with a bridle of twisted
rawhide heavily plaqued with silver; the saddle,
of high-pommeled Spanish style, was also heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
incrusted; and the man sat it as though he had
been poured molten into it. He wore a wide,
flapping sombrero, set cavalierly upon long white
hair that descended to the shoulders of his
fringed buckskin jacket; the belt at his waist
drooped loosely to the weight of a great holster,
out of which protruded the lustrous butt of a
silver-mounted revolver; long gleaming boots rose
to his hips, their toes within carved tapaderos,
their heels, high to the point of feminity, roweled
with long rotary spurs.</p>

<p>They stood there a long time, man and beast,
motionless, a sculptured group but for the slight
forward pricking of the horse's pointed ears,
and the man gazed steadily at Charles-Norton,
his eyes shaded by his heavily-buckskinned hand.
Charles-Norton, hypnotized, gazed back. There
was something about the man, his flaming accouterment,
specially about the gesture&mdash;the
theatric peering from beneath gauntleted hand&mdash;which
somehow stirred Charles-Norton with a
sense of past experience. They gazed thus long
at each other in immobility and silence; then
suddenly there ran lightly through the meadow
the resonance of a champed bit; the horse, rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
on his hind legs, pivoted, the man's waist bending
pliably to the movement&mdash;and they were gone.
A soft thudding of hoofs came muffled through
the trees; it rose to a flinty clatter, which in its
turn diminished, and ceased.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, after a while, went on with his
usual routine. He had his swim, his breakfast,
and his pipe. But an uneasiness was with him
now; he cast abrupt, suspecting glances about
him, about his profaned retreat. And during the
day's long flight, something seemed to follow him
like an impalpable menace.</p>

<p>When he returned at sundown, the man was
again there. This time he was among the rocks
overlooking the cabin, and was afoot, his white
horse motionless behind him with long bridle
dropped to the ground. Charles-Norton watched
him from behind a tree. He stood there long, his
right hand negligently upon the horse's neck, his
left hand shielding his eyes as he looked; and
to the posture, somehow, the whole landscape
gradually changed its aspect, seemed to take on
an air subtly theatrical, the waning sunlight like
calcium, the rocks like cardboard, the trees
painted. "Where, oh, where have I seen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
before?" murmured Charles-Norton, intrigued in
the midst of his panic.</p>

<p>The man mounted, the horse came forward, and
with a silvery tinkle of spur and bit, they went
slowly across the meadow and into the forest, toward
the trail that led to the camp.</p>

<p>"<i>Where</i> have I seen that geezer before?" murmured
Charles-Norton again, as he was going to
sleep that night.</p>

<p>The question was to remain unanswered. The
man did not appear again. But on the Sunday
following, at dusk, as the lake was aflash with
leaping trout, Dolly came running to him out of
the trees.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Dolly came suddenly out of the fringe of
the trees. It was dusk; the lake was
aflash with leaping trout. And she came
to him across the darkened meadow like a fawn
panting for her retreat. He stood there petrified,
but as she neared, felt his arms open in an irresistible
and large movement; she nestled within
them, her head on his heart.</p>

<p>They stood there long, without speaking a
word, in the center of the dusky meadow, by the
sparkling lake. Her face was on his breast; his
arms were about her, but his eyes were looking
straight ahead into the obscurity. He could feel
her palpitate softly against him, and a tenderness
like a warm pool was collecting in his
heart.</p>

<p>"Dolly!" he said at length.</p>

<p>But she did not answer; only pushed farther
into his embrace in a blind little snuggling movement
like that of a puppy. He dropped his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
down upon her, slyly. He could see her shoulders,
agitated as if she were weeping, and a wisp of
her golden hair, and one tip of a rosy ear; and
then, nearer, he saw the furry toque with its
white aigrette.</p>

<p>"You little Cossack!" he said, a bit huskily.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence; then he felt the
vibration of her muffled voice against his chest.
"Do you like it?" she asked timidly.</p>

<p>"It's dandy," he said.</p>

<p>The silence that followed was like that of a
kitten after a cup of cream. Then the voice
sounded again within the depths of his embrace.</p>

<p>"O, Goosie," she sobbed; "I've been so miserable!"</p>

<p>"Poor little girl," he growled, above there in
the dark; "poor little girl!"</p>

<p>"All my money is gone, Goosie&mdash;and the janitor
was impolite and treated me dreadfully, and
oh, Goosie, I've had such a terrible time!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," he said soothingly (I'll kill
that janitor, he thought, gnashing his teeth).</p>

<p>"Goosie," began the voice again; "you won't
drive me away, will you? You won't drive me
away; I can stay to-night, can't I? It's so dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and so cold! And in the morning, if you still
don't want me, I'll&mdash;I'll go away, Goosie. I'll
go away and never, never bother you any more,
Goosie; never! But let me stay to-night; Goosie,
don't drive me away to-night!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" groaned Charles-Norton, horrified
at the very possibility, and suddenly overwhelmed
by a sense of the enormity of his past
conduct. "Good God, Dolly! don't, don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can stay&mdash;then&mdash;to-night?" she asked, with
a glimmer of hope, of hope that cannot believe
itself. "I can stay to-night, Goosie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dolly, you can stay to-night, you can
stay to-morrow night, you can stay always,
Dolly, poor little Dolly," moaned the agonized
Charles-Norton. "We'll stay here, always, together,
Dolly. Never will I move from you
again, Dolly; Dolly, my little wife, my love,
my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dolly snuggled back close. "Oh, Goosie," she
said, "if you let me stay, I'll be so good! I
won't bother you at all, Goosie. You can do
just what you want; I'll let you have&mdash;anything!
I won't bother you, you won't know I'm here.
I'll just hide around and take care of you, Goosie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
I'll do <i>anything</i>! If only you'll let me stay,
Goosie!"</p>

<p>"Come," he said, not daring to give his voice
much of a chance; "come; let us go in."</p>

<p>The little nose suddenly popped out like a
squirrel's out of its hole. She no longer wept,
though he could see a tear still at the end of one
of her lashes, agleam in the dark. She raised her
head out of his arms and looked about her.
"Oh," she cried, "is that your house? What
a cute baby-house! It's pretty here, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is beautiful!" he said enthusiastically.
"We'll be happy here. Come," he said; and very
close, her head upon his shoulders, his arm about
her waist, they went slowly across the meadow
to the cabin.</p>

<p>It was pleasant, somehow, the next morning,
to loll about with trailing wings, undesirous of
flight. The cabin, the meadow, had taken on a
certain intimacy, a coziness; it was pleasant to
remain there all day, upon earth, idle-winged.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton had his morning swim alone
after vain attempts to entice Dolly, her eyes
still full of blue sleep, into the crystal waters.
Then he fished from his rock&mdash;twice as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
he usually fished. And when he returned with
his string of rainbows, Dolly, uncovering the
dutch-oven which he had bought on his arrival,
but the mystery of which he had never mastered,
proudly showed him the cracked golden dome
of a swelling loaf of bread. Its warm fragrance
mingled with the pungent puffs coming from
the curved nozzle of the coffee-pot, set in the
glowing coals. He gave her the fish, all cleaned,
and rolling them in corn-meal, she laid them
delicately in the sizzling frying-pan, each by the
side of a marbled strip of bacon.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that this breakfast was an
improvement on breakfasts that had gone before.
Bread is mighty good when one has not had any
for nearly two months; and warm golden bread
just out of the oven and made by Dolly is more
than mighty good. The coffee had undeniably
an aroma that it had not had of past mornings.
And as you held up to the light, delicately between
thumb and finger, a little trout with
crisply-curved tail, and slipped it head first between
eager white teeth, your eyes smiled into
two other eyes (like blue stars), smiling back at
you over just such another troutlet, golden crisp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
entering in successive movements between just
such eager teeth (small pearly ones, these).</p>

<p>Oh, you Charles-Norton!</p>

<p>He wore a blanket on his back, undulating
from his shoulders, over his wings, to the ground.
Dolly had put it there, fearing he would catch
cold. Now and then, by some reflex action of
which Charles-Norton was unconscious, the wings
stirred uneasily to the burden and let it slip to
the ground, upon which Dolly, springing up with
a laugh, quickly replaced it. This happened so
often that it became a game.</p>

<p>After breakfast Dolly, instead of throwing the
dishes in a shallow spot of the lake, as it was
the habit of Master Charles-Norton, placed them
in a pot of boiling water, at the bottom of which,
with wonder-eyes, he saw them miraculously dissolve
to brightness. "You're a genius, Dolly,"
he said. She laughed, a silver peal that filled the
clearing, then, going into the cabin, returned
with his pipe all filled. Nicodemus came to
them for his salt, then wandered off again. They
sat side by side, their backs against the cabin-wall,
the meadow before them, sloping to the
lake; he smoked, and she was silent. The sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
had risen. It inundated the western slopes with
a cascade of light; here and there on the crest
glaciers flashed signals; far to the west the
plain palpitated liquidly; and above, the sky
domed very high, a miracle of pellucid azure.
A big sigh escaped Charles-Norton, with a blue
wafture of smoke. "Isn't this beautiful?" he
said; "isn't it beautiful?"</p>

<p>She said nothing, and so he repeated, "Isn't it
beautiful?" And then, curious of her silence,
he turned to her. She was looking about her,
at the trees, at the lake, and the great crags
above, and as she looked, with an unconscious
movement, she withdrew closer to him. "It's
awfully big," she said, and her voice was almost
a whisper.</p>

<p>"It's big with beauty," he said. "Look at
the lake," he went on, detailing with the pride
of a suburban proprietor; "isn't it silvery and
fresh and clean!"</p>

<p>"It's cold, isn't it?" said Dolly.</p>

<p>"And the crest up there. Look at it. It is
sculptured&mdash;domes, spires, castles. And those
gothic arches. They are like joined hands; the
granite prays. And see the glisten of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
glacier in the haze, like a star in the veil of a
bride! It's all beautiful!"</p>

<p>"They're terribly big mountains, aren't they?"
said Dolly.</p>

<p>"See the plain away down there. It seems
to heave slowly, like the flood after the rain had
ceased."</p>

<p>"Do people live there?" asked Dolly.</p>

<p>"And the sky; did you ever see such sky!
And the meadow here, how fresh and lush; and
the pines, and the cabin, and the lake&mdash;isn't it
all quiet and peaceful?"</p>

<p>She was silent, and after a while he turned
to her. A tear was trembling at the end of one
of her long lashes. "Goosie," she whispered,
and she snuggled up against him; "Goosie, isn't
it a bit&mdash;lonely here?"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> won't find it lonely," he answered stoutly,
and drew her close within his arms.</p>

<p>The day drawled on, slowly and deliciously.
"Let's take a little walk," said Dolly, after a
while.</p>

<p>"All right," said Charles-Norton, "I guess I
still know how. I haven't walked much lately."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Dolly, hesitatingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>They were going side by side across the meadow,
and Charles-Norton could feel her looking at
him out of the corner of her eye. "I suppose&mdash;you
have been&mdash;doing something else."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Charles-Norton, flushing a bit;
"yes&mdash;something else."</p>

<p>Somehow they did not look at each other for a
time after that, and walked a bit apart.</p>

<p>They drew together again little by little as
they wandered over the clearing, in a close examination
of their domain, which Charles-Norton,
with his passion for big flights and sweeping
outlooks, had up to now neglected. They found
a miniature cascade that purled over a mossy log;
a cave, so small and clean and regular that it
seemed not the work of the big Nature about
them, but of delicate, elfin hands; and then, on
the edge of forest and grass, a flower, a trembling
white chalice upon the virginal bosom of which
one small touch of color burned like a flame.
And thus, little step after little step, they went
from little wonder to little wonder. Dolly liked
small things; it was the microscopic aspect of
Nature that touched her heart; she had an adjective
all her own for such: they were "baby"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
things&mdash;baby flowers, baby brooks, baby stars.
This appealed less to Charles-Norton, hungry for
big sweeps. And even now, he caught himself
yawning once, and casting a look at the crest far
away.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, in the full warmth of the
clear sun, he inveigled her into the lake for a
swim. They splashed in the silver waters like
merman and mermaid; and when, after a glistening
disappearance within the cabin, Dolly
emerged again, she was tucked in a fuzzy bathrobe
that made her look like a little bear.</p>

<p>They sat long afterward on a warm slope in
the sun. Crickets hopped about them; Charles-Norton
at intervals heard by his side Dolly's
musical giggle as one of them struck her. A bird
on a long twig balanced above them, and for a
time a squirrel chattered at them in mock scolding
from the top of a pine. Little by little
Charles-Norton sank into a profundity of well-being.
He could see ahead, now, his life stretching
placid and colored, solved at last, with both
Dolly and the wings, uniting love and freedom,
the ecstasies of flight with the tenderness of
home&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<p>"Goosie," said Dolly; "let's go in."</p>

<p>The sun was gone. It had sunk into the plain,
far off. "Wait," he whispered, looking toward
the crest, inflamed with living light. The peaks
gleamed, the domes glowed, the glaciers flashed,
the whole sky-line crackled with a great band of
color. Then swiftly from the plain a shadow ran
up the mountain sides, extinguished, one after
the other, peak, and dome, and glacier; it went up
toward the clouds with its long swift lope: the
clouds became burned rags.</p>

<p>"Let us go in," said Dolly.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said.</p>

<p>The night was pouring in over the crest, filling
the meadow, the dome above; a velvety blueness
palpitated vaguely about them; a star, as if
touched by an unseen torch, suddenly sprang to
light.</p>

<p>"Wait," murmured Charles-Norton; "it is
beautiful at this hour."</p>

<p>But Dolly pressed against him with a little
shiver. "I'm cold, Goosie," she cried; "let us
go in."</p>

<p>They rose, went down the slope and across
the meadow. Along the grass a frigid little haze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
was forming; it was true that it was cold. If
Charles-Norton had been a practical man he
would have observed that for the last two weeks,
in fact, the nights had been growing more and
more cold&mdash;which might have introduced a disturbing
factor in his dream of the coming days.
But Charles-Norton, as has been seen, was not
a practical man.</p>

<p>They sat within, by a glowing fire. "It's nice
to be home," said Dolly. "It's fine," said
Charles-Norton, stoutly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>
<hr />

<p class="cap">For three days Charles-Norton remained
on earth sedulously. It was a pleasant
earth. They wandered together in the
small area about the cabin; they walked, swam,
fished, picked flowers, and spent hours concocting,
on the fire before the cabin, nice little dishes
which they negotiated gourmandly, like children.
On the second day Nicodemus, furry and fat with
idleness, was saddled, and they three went down
the trail toward the camp. Charles-Norton hid
on the fringe of the forest while Dolly shopped
sagely in the general store, to the general approval
of the somnolent inhabitants who, by this
time, had diminished to five; and then they returned
in the twilight, Nicodemus a bit wistful
with the weight of the many useful and good
things within his bags. They worked about the
cabin the next day, and Dolly performed wonders
with burlap and chintz. Curtains draped the
three small windows, a carpet spread upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
floor, and on the big tree-trunk which, sawed off
evenly in the center of the cabin, served as a
table, a shining lamp was set, promising of calm
evenings.</p>

<p>"We'll live here forever!" cried Charles-Norton,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Dolly did not answer; her back was turned and
she was busy tacking chintz along one of the
bunks.</p>

<p>On the fourth morning Charles-Norton felt a
vague hunger which breakfast did not satisfy.
It was with him all day as he wandered on the
ground, the tips of his long wings stained with
grass. It was with him stronger the following
morning; and after breakfast, he sprang suddenly
into the air. "Look!" he cried to Dolly.</p>

<p>And before her, above the meadow, he went
through his flying repertory. He cut clashing
diagonals through the air; he rose and fell in
undulations like music; he shot about, gleaming
white against the blue sky; and finally he came
down to her from the very zenith of the dome
in a sizzing straight line which opened, almost
at her feet, in a white explosion of suddenly extended
wings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>"You baby!" said Dolly, as once more he
stood before her, panting slightly, and his eyes
dilated; "you baby!" she said, indulgently.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, shifting his position to one
foot, scratched his head. Somehow, this was not
quite what he had expected. He had thought
Dolly more changed about this flying business;
and here she seemed&mdash;well, not so very much
changed. Within him he felt something vaguely
bristle. It was still bristling there the next
morning, and gave to his voice a certain brusqueness
when, kissing Dolly on the forehead after
breakfast, he said: "Well, so long, Dolly!"</p>

<p>"So long," he said; and Dolly, from her seat
on the sward, saw him leap from her and wing
away in powerful flight. He made straight for
the crest; she saw him, flitting up there, a little
white confetti in the eddy of a breeze. Rising,
falling, darting capriciously, he gradually slid
off down the range, and was gone.</p>

<p>Dolly rose. The meadow suddenly had become
very quiet. A tree, sap-bursting, cracked
resoundingly; the sound went through her like
a sliver. She stood there, poised as if for flight,
feeling upon her from every tree, rock and bush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the hostile eyes of peering things; and she was
mighty glad when Nicodemus came running to
her resonantly across the clearing, demanding
a pancake.</p>

<p>Somehow, Charles-Norton did not enjoy his
flight as much as he had expected. He bore
with him a vague uneasiness which no amount
of speeding could quite lose. He could feel, all
the time, Dolly away down there alone in the
deserted meadow. He returned much earlier
than usual.</p>

<p>Dolly was cooking by the fire in the clearing,
and she greeted him cheerfully, without the
slightest sign of reproach. After a while,
though, he noted upon her right cheek a little
smudge. It was shaped like a miniature comet;
it was, rather, like the slight sediment left upon
a window-pane by a drop of rain. Charles-Norton,
determinedly, refused to see it. But it was
there all the same.</p>

<p>And it was there the next day when he returned,
and the next, and the next. Each night,
as he lit again upon earth after his long voyaging
of the air, Dolly greeted him with an
ostentatious cheerfulness beneath which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
be felt something subtly plaintive, and on her
cheek&mdash;sometimes the right, sometimes the
left&mdash;always would be the little accusing
smudge.</p>

<p>It spoiled his flights. Following the three
days spent on earth, the hunger of the spaces
had come back to him, gnawing at his vitals;
each morning he was leaving earlier, each evening
he was returning later. But all the time, in
his wildest soarings, there went with him ... a
leaden pellet, a little leaden pellet, very stubborn
and indissoluble, there in his heart ... the
knowledge that, alighting, at the end he would
have to face that little black smudge; that he
would have to meet Dolly's cheerful greeting
with its subtle, plaintive undercurrent, and the
faint smudge upon her cheek.</p>

<p>Dolly, as a matter of fact, was not weeping
all the time, down there in the meadow. The
care of the cabin, the preparation of the meals,
gave her each day several hours of humming
content; and in the afternoon she would have
several good romps with Nicodemus. But there
were also heavy hours during which the solitude
of the land seemed to draw nigh from all sides;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
when she panted, almost, to its pressure, and
felt very little and miserable indeed. So that
Charles-Norton, dropping like an archangel out
of the sky, found always upon her cheek the
trace of an erasure made completely enough to
show a determination to hide tears, but not quite
enough to obliterate the determination; and leaving
in the morning, he felt her eyes wistful upon
him in a humble and unspoken reproach which
all day followed him, stubborn as his own
shadow, the shadow which he could never escape.
He fought well, did Charles-Norton. He tried
hard not to see the little black smudge, not to
think about it; and above all, not to let
her know that he saw it. But all the time
the weight was there within him, spoiling his
flights.</p>

<p>One morning, seeing in a sudden flash of naïve
hope a solution of their problem, he tried to take
her with him. Making a sling out of a strip of
blanket, he passed it about his waist, sat her
in the slack, and rose in the air. Thus, holding
her beneath the shadow of his wings as in a
swing, he flitted about, above the meadow, rising,
chuting down in long, smooth slants, circling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
soaring. Once he thought he heard from her a
slight suppressed cry, and then, after a while,
astonished at her silence, he came down to the
shore of the lake.</p>

<p>Her eyes were closed, her cheeks were white,
and her hands were cold; and it was only after
he had dashed water upon her that she revived.</p>

<p>"Dolly, Dolly," he murmured.</p>

<p>She looked at him, smiling bravely with her
white lips. "Goosie, dear," she said, a bit
wearily; "Goosie, dear, I can't. I can't
dear. I get dizzy. It makes me dreadfully
sick."</p>

<p>He stood there on one leg, embarrassed. He
wanted to take her in his arms in great tenderness,
but was held back by the tenacity of his
purpose, by the knowledge of the peril of such
a course.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Dolly, finally. "Go, Goosie;
go on and fly. I'll stay here. With Nicodemus,"
she added wistfully.</p>

<p>And Charles-Norton, the brute, still inexorable,
flapped his great wings and went away,
leaving her there in the meadow alone, with
Nicodemus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>But he was to get his punishment. A few
days later, returning at night, he found Dolly
truly weeping.</p>

<p>She was kneeling by the fire, frying-pan in
hand, preparing the evening meal; and at regular
intervals two big dew-drops trickled out from
her lowered lashes and dropped upon her hand.
Charles-Norton, abashed and puzzled, went about
a while, making a great show of occupation, and
pretending not to see. And then, suddenly, out
of the corner of his eyes he noted the rag which
she had wrapped about the handle of the frying-pan.
It was not the usual rag. It was a filmy
thing within which ran a color like a flame.
Lordy&mdash;it was the scarf which, several weeks
before, he had stolen one night from the girl
on the veranda, in the inn above the valley, and
which he had since forgotten in the clothes-bag
that served him as pillow.</p>

<p>He kept a prudent silence, and pretended not
to see it, though vaguely tormented by the very
menial service to which Dolly successively put
that once radiant scarf. And Dolly said not a
word about it. She went on with her little housekeeping
routine very carefully and submissively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
while now and again a tear oozed from her long
lashes. But Charles-Norton felt vaguely now
that the balance had swung, that he was fighting
now at a terrible disadvantage.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Charles-Norton began to grow peevish.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," he would growl, as he
flew along the crest; "why can't she smile once,
for a change, as I leave her in the morning; why
can't she speed me away with a smile, instead of
that look. Why can't she be happy in her own
way down there, and let me be happy up here?
Why, why, why?"</p>

<p>He was passing just then a deep gorge, blue
beneath him. From it his question reascended
to him, tenuous and fluttering, like a lost bird
on uncertain wings. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"She looks at me&mdash;as if I were a murderer.
Just because I want to fly. Just because I have
wings. Just because everything in me says, Fly!
And I have to carry that look around with me all
day long, just like a net, just like a net of crape.
Dam!"</p>

<p>"Dam!" said the profundities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>Charles-Norton evidently had arrived at the
self-pitying stage&mdash;which was a bad sign, if he
only had known it; which showed a certain weakening
of his moral fiber. He fought on, though.
Resolutely he continued to refuse to notice the
daily little black smudge upon Dolly's cheek.
She was more submissive and dolorous than ever.
She had made him, with blankets, a union-suit
that buttoned ingeniously about the roots of his
wings; he put it on every morning, but hid it
behind a rock till night as soon as he was out
of sight.</p>

<p>But the very elements, the perversity of matter,
seemed against Charles-Norton. "There's no
more flour, Goosie," said Dolly one morning.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton did not catch the significance
of this remark right away. Perched on one foot,
just in the act of taking wing, he had become
absorbed in the examination of a fluffy and cold
little white object which had just then settled
upon his nose. He looked at it close as it disappeared
between his fingers in a silver trickle.
It was a snow-flake. He glanced upward; the
sky was very gray.</p>

<p>"Goosie, the flour is gone," repeated Dolly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>Charles-Norton came back to earth. "Well,
we'll have to buy some more," he said, again
preparing for flight.</p>

<p>Dolly was silent, evidently considering this
remark. "Have you&mdash;have you any more&mdash;money?"
she asked at length, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton dropped his wings. "No," he
said. "No, that I haven't&mdash;not a cent. It's&mdash;it's
gone. Have you?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> haven't any," said Dolly. Her eyes were
very big.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton stood there motionless a while,
a bit disturbed. Then his lower jaw advanced;
he shrugged his shoulders: "Well&mdash;I'll see
about it; to-morrow," he said airily, and was off.</p>

<p>But he didn't see about anything "to-morrow"
or after. He had a fine time that day. A snow-flurry
was passing down the Sierra, and he went
with it along the crest, mile after mile, to the
South, the center of its soft white whirl, its
winged tutelary God. When he returned, that
night, a snow-carpet extended down from the top
of the chain, down the slopes, to the edge of the
meadow. Dolly was inside of the cabin, close to
the fireplace. "Ooh, Goosie, but it's cold," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
cried. "Yes," admitted Charles-Norton; "it is
cold." His wings were encased in ice, and he
sparkled rosily in the fire's glow.</p>

<p>The next day, though, was warmer; the carpet
of snow gradually retreated up the slopes. It
remained on the crest, however, frozen and scintillating.
It was a world of increased beauty
that now spread beneath Charles-Norton. The
crest glittered from horizon to horizon; here and
there little lakes gleamed like hard diamonds;
and lower, the willows in the hollows lay very
light, like painted vapor.</p>

<p>The next morning Dolly said: "There's no
sugar, Goosie."</p>

<p>"Coffee is better without sugar," said Charles-Norton,
sententiously.</p>

<p>For a few days the young couple, with wry
faces, drank unsweetened coffee. Then this difficulty
disappeared. Taking up the tin before
breakfast, Dolly discovered that there was no
more coffee.</p>

<p>The last of the canned fruit followed, and
the last slice of bacon.</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord we can live on trout," said
Charles-Norton, piously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>
<p>As if in answer, the next morning, the trout
refused to take his bait of red flannel.</p>

<p>Alone there on the shore of the lake, while
Dolly waited within the cabin, Charles-Norton
passed a bad quarter-of-an-hour. Then he went
up the slopes back of the meadow and captured
a handful of grasshoppers springing there in the
rising sun. The trout took them with gratitude.
"Whee!" said Charles-Norton, when at last he
had his catch.</p>

<p>And then, to a cold blast from the East, a few
days later, the grasshoppers all disappeared.
Charles-Norton took his axe, went into the
woods, and chopping open mouldy logs, obtained
a store of white grub. The trout took
them.</p>

<p>But Fatality now was dogging him close.
When, with tingling skin, he opened the cabin-door
a few mornings later, a cry escaped him.
A snow-carpet spread from the crest over the
face of the whole visible world, clear down to
the western plain. It covered deep the meadow,
hung in miniature mountain-chains on the
boughs of the pines, filigreed the lake. The
lake was frozen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>Charles-Norton chopped a hole in the ice, then
chopped logs and replenished his supply of grubs.
The trout refused them. They could not be
blamed; the grubs, hibernating, had shrunk
themselves into hard little sticks devoid of the
least suspicion of succulence.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton and Dolly went breakfastless
that morning. All day Charles-Norton roamed
above the land with a vague idea of catching
something. But living creatures seemed to have
withdrawn into the earth; the few still out had
put on white liveries; when Charles-Norton flew
low, they fled him, and when he flew high, he
could not distinguish them from the earth's impassive
mantle. He thought once of the ranch
in the plain and of its chicken-yard, but dropped
the idea immediately. Dolly's vigorous little
New England conscience would never accept a
compromise such as this.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton and Dolly that night went
supperless to bed; they arose in the morning with
no prospect of breakfast. Charles-Norton moped
long at the fire while Dolly, very wisely silent,
trotted about her work. Suddenly Charles-Norton
rose with a smothered exclamation. In two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
strides he made for the door, opened it, and took
wing; Dolly saw him flitting among the branches
of the pines in mysterious occupation. He returned
in great triumph and threw on the table
a double handful of small, dry objects that looked
like wooden beans. "We'll eat pine-nuts!" he
cried enthusiastically. "Pine-nuts are just
chuck full of protein!"</p>

<p>For three days they lived on pine-nuts. And
then, as on the third evening, they sat before the
little heap which made their meal, Dolly fell
forward on the table with a wide movement of
her arms that scattered the supper in a dry
tinkle to the floor, and remained thus with heaving
shoulders.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton rose and stood above her.
Dolly was weeping this time, truly weeping, beyond
the slightest doubt, openly and freely. This
was the end; he was cornered at last, his last
twisting over. She wept there in an abandonment
of woe, her face in her arms, her hair desolate
on the surface of the table, her shoulders
palpitating. And as he gazed down upon her,
a great, vague mournfulness slowly rose through
him, a mournfulness part regret, part sacrifice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
he stood there gazing down upon her as a child
gazing down on a broken toy, a broken toy in
the ruin of which lay the ruin of his dreams.
She wept; and he felt as if a wreath, a wreath
soft and flowery but very heavy, had fallen about
his neck and were drawing him down, down out
of the altitudes of his will. And so, gently,
he asked the question, the answer of which
he knew, the asking of which was renunciation.</p>

<p>"Dolly, Dolly," he whispered; "what is the
matter, Dolly?"</p>

<p>"Ooh, ooh, ooh," sobbed Dolly; "ooh, Goosie,
I can't&mdash;can't eat pine-nuts, Goosie! I
can't!"</p>

<p>Her shoulders shook, the table trembled, her
wail rose to a perfect little whistle of woe.
Charles-Norton sat down by her and took her
in his arms. "Well, we won't have to, Dolly,"
he said gently; "us won't have to. We&mdash;we'll
go back!"</p>

<p>They remained thus long, entwined, while little
by little the violence of Dolly's despair moderated.
At length she freed herself, with a smile
like the sunlight of an April shower, and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with a little catch in her throat, took the lamp
from the table and set it on the sill of the western
window.</p>

<p>Half an hour later there was a knock at
the door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<hr />

<p class="cap">After a moment of indecision, during
which Dolly, rosy with excitement, was
hurriedly rearranging her disordered
apparel, Charles-Norton, picking up the lamp,
strode to the door and opened it. His lips were
unable to hold a short exclamation of surprise.
For, framed in the door-way, here stood the
mysterious stranger whom twice he had caught
watching him in the meadow.</p>

<p>He stood there, very tall, soft hat in hand,
his white hair and cavalier mustachios shining
softly in the rays of the lamp, the fringes of his
buckskin garments all aglitter with the cold;
above his right shoulder there peered affectionately
the white face of his horse, the vague loom
of whom could be divined behind in the night.
He placed his right foot upon the lintel, and to
the movement his long spur tinkled in a single
silver note. "May I come in?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
"Why, yes; why, yes," exclaimed Charles-Norton,
recovering from his momentary petrifaction;
"come in, make yourself at home, have
a chair, have a seat!"</p>

<p>"Back!" said the man, over his shoulder, and
to the command the inquisitive nose of the white
horse receded in the darkness. The man shut
the door, behind which, immediately, a philosophical
munching of bit began to sound. He
walked across the room with a low bow which
caused the wide brim of his hat to sweep the
floor; and to Charles-Norton's invitation sat himself
on the bench by the fireplace. Dolly perched
herself on the side of her bunk, Charles-Norton
on his. They formed thus a triangle, of which
the stranger was the apex. Dolly's face was
flushed, her eyes were bright, but she kept them
carefully averted from the gleaming visitor.
Charles-Norton, on the contrary, stared at him
frankly. A reminiscence was coming slowly,
like a light, into his brain.</p>

<p>"I've seen you before," he said. "Twice I've
seen you with your horse, here, among the
rocks."</p>

<p>"Did you see me?" said the man, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I couldn't place you then. But now I know.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>I know who you are. You're Bison Billiam,
aren't you; Bison Billiam, the great scout."</p>

<p>"So I am popularly known," said the man,
with a bow.</p>

<p>"I remember you. It's ten, twelve years ago.
You came out of a lot of cardboard scenery at
the end of the hall, hunting buffaloes. The
calcium light was on you, and you looked like
this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Charles-Norton placed his right hand
above his eyes in most approved scouting style,
and peered to right and left. "Humph," said
Bison Billiam, seemingly not altogether delighted
with this representation.</p>

<p>"And you saw the buffalo&mdash;three of them&mdash;father
and mother and son, I guess&mdash;standing
in the center of the arena. You galloped right
into them, and emptied the magazine of your
Winchester into them&mdash;but they wouldn't run.
They knew you too well, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I suppose," agreed Bison Billiam. "The
buffaloes I've hunted in the last twenty years
have known me pretty well. It was not so once,"
he said reminiscently; "not so, not so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a little silence at this evocation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the melancholy of gone days. The fire crackled.
It was Bison Billiam who spoke first. "I've
been watching you fly," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes?" exclaimed Charles-Norton, flushing
with pleasure and doubt.</p>

<p>"I have a permanent show in New York now,"
went on Bison Billiam.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Charles-Norton.</p>

<p>"I want you to fly there," said Bison Billiam.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Charles-Norton.</p>

<p>"I'll give you four hundred a week."</p>

<p>Charles-Norton fell backward into his bunk,
his legs swaying perpendicularly in the air like
two derricks gone amuck. From the depths of
his involuntary position he heard the silvery
pealing of Dolly's laughter. When he rose again
though, Dolly had ceased laughing, and Bison
Billiam's face had a gravity which somehow
vaguely impressed Charles-Norton as without
solidity, like fresh varnish. The two looked as
though they had been gazing at each other, but
their eyes now were carefully averted.</p>

<p>"I didn't understand," said Charles-Norton,
with dignity, and surreptitiously took a firm hold
of the edge of the bunk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>"The matter is simply this," said Bison Billiam.
"I have a permanent Wild West show
in New York. I want a new feature for it. You
are it. I'll give you three hundred a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Four hundred; you said four hundred!"
exclaimed Dolly.</p>

<p>He turned to her with a bow which held homage.
"Four hundred," he corrected.</p>

<p>"What will I have to do?" asked Charles-Norton,
still somewhat dazed.</p>

<p>"Just fly. Fly every night, and at the matinees,
Wednesdays and Saturdays. The police
will stand for it, I think&mdash;except on Sundays.
But we'll settle the details later. Meanwhile,
here's the contract." He fumbled in the inside
of his buckskin jacket and drew out a typewritten
document.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton stood long over the contract,
spread out on the table. He pretended to read
it, but was too agitated to do so. The little
purple characters danced in the glow of the lamp.
Upon his right shoulder he could feel Dolly's
chin; it rested there tenderly, with wistfulness,
in prayer. Mixed with his excitement was a
vague sadness, a sadness, somehow, as though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
were saying farewell to someone. But he had
already gone through the crisis; to Dolly's heart-rending
cry upon the dietary inadequacy of pine-nuts,
he had yielded his whole being in supreme
sacrifice. An exultation possessed him at the
thought, a madness of self-gift. He straightened
to his full height; "I'll sign!" he cried
with ringing accent.</p>

<p>He felt Dolly turn about him; she laid her
head upon his breast. "Sh-sh, sh-sh," he whispered,
patting her; "it's all right, Dolly." He
raised his head once more. "I'll sign!" he declared
again loudly.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so," murmured Bison Billiam,
a bit amazed at all this ceremony. Out
of the holster which hung on his belt, he drew
a fountain-pen, which lay snugly by the silver-mounted
revolver. And Charles-Norton, his left
arm about Dolly, with his right hand signed
firmly the contract.</p>

<p>"I'll be back in the morning," said Bison
Billiam as he mounted his horse. "You'll give
me an exhibition, and we'll settle on your stunt
and on the size of your machine&mdash;your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his last word flew away with him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
night. Charles-Norton closed the door. There
was a little silence. "What did he mean?"
asked Charles-Norton; "what did he mean by
the size, the size of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Dolly. "Goosie,
you are a dear; a darling, Goosie. Goosie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right, little girl," said Charles-Norton
with large magnanimity; "glad to do it
for you." And then, nudging Dolly with his
elbow, "four hundred a week, Dolly; four hundred!
Gee!" he cried.</p>

<p>The practical side of Charles-Norton seemed
at last awakened; he danced around the table
in glee. But Dolly, singularly, did not join in.</p>

<p>The next morning, bright and early, Dolly and
Charles-Norton heard a haloo outside and, emerging,
found Bison Billiam erect upon his
motionless horse in the center of the snow-covered
meadow. "You've had breakfast?" he
asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes," said Dolly; "just got through,"
said the little liar (there wasn't anything within
the cabin to breakfast upon).</p>

<p>"We'll begin right away, then," said Bison
Billiam. "We leave at noon."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>He dismounted, and Dolly and he seated themselves
side by side, with backs against the cabin,
while Charles-Norton gave them an exhibition.</p>

<p>He winged off first directly for the crest gleaming
high in the distance, making his line straight
and swift; then returned in a perfect curve that
spanned the distance like a rainbow. Remaining
above the meadow, now, he drew all his fantasies
against the sky and finally, rising high till he
was a mere dot in the heavens, he shot down
like a white thunderbolt and landed at their
feet in snowy explosion of extended wings.</p>

<p>He found Bison Billiam and Dolly conferring
earnestly. "Two feet, I think," Bison Billiam
said. Dolly ran into the cabin and returned
with a pair of glittering scissors.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Charles-Norton,
suddenly cold and distrustful.</p>

<p>"Cut off two feet," said Dolly, laughingly.
"Mr. Billiam says to cut off two feet."</p>

<p>"Off my wings?" yelped Charles-Norton; "off
my wings?"</p>

<p>Dolly turned her eyes to Bison Billiam in
doubt, in appeal. "It's in the contract, young
man," said Bison Billiam. "Haven't you read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the contract?" he said, drawing the document
from his jacket.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," said Charles-Norton, shortly.
"Let me see it."</p>

<p>And he read, beneath Bison Billiam's pointing
finger: "It shall be regarded as a part of this
agreement that the length of the flying apparatus,
whatsoever it may be, shall be determined by the
party of the first part."</p>

<p>"I won't!" thundered Charles-Norton.</p>

<p>"Goosie, dear," implored Dolly; "Goosie,
dear, only two feet, and it's in the contract,
Goosie, dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned upon her fiercely. "Why can't you
eat pine-nuts?" he cried; "why, why, why?"</p>

<p>She drew back a step and looked at him with
great large eyes, and as he met them, he saw
them fill slowly with tears. "I can't," she said
simply; "I can't, Goosie." Again Charles-Norton
had that sensation of a wreath falling about
his neck, a heavy wreath within the soft flowers
of which was hidden a good stout chain. "All
right; go ahead," he said, with a sigh.</p>

<p>Dolly, with the firmness of a surgeon inexorably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
sure of what is best for his patient, curtailed
the "flying apparatus" to the required
length. "Now, let's see you," said Bison Billiam.</p>

<p>And Charles-Norton repeated his performance,
more heavily this time, in smaller compass. But
when he descended, again he was met by Bison
Billiam's disapproving head-shake. "We'll have
to take off another foot," said Bison Billiam.</p>

<p>"But why?" remonstrated Charles-Norton
(with the first cut there had already come to him
a certain lassitude, an indifference, almost, which
made him much more tractable). "Why do you
want my wings short?" (also he was conscious of
a feeling of aspiration amidships, of aspiration
for something else than pine-nuts). "Don't you
want me to fly well? What the deuce is the
matter?"</p>

<p>"It won't do; it won't do at all," said Bison
Billiam, in a tone almost of discouragement.
"Can't you <i>see</i> it won't do?" he went on impatiently.
"It's too smooth; there's no effort
in it. Lord, you do it as though it were <i>easy</i>!
And there's no <i>danger</i> in it, man! Lord, I sit
here and watch you without batting an eye-lid;
feeling sure you can't fall. That's not what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
want. I want the audience to get excited, to
palpitate! I don't want them to sit there like
lambs watching a cloud, or a bird flying. Your
act isn't worth two-bits a week. I want men
to groan, children to scream, women to faint!
Lop 'em off!"</p>

<p>Again Charles-Norton submitted himself to
Dolly's gentle fingers and cold scissors, and repeated
his act with shortened wings. This happened
three times. Three times the scissors
zipped, down eddied to the ground, and Charles-Norton
tried again, more heavily, more soddenly,
his being invaded by the emptiness of the old
days, the shorn days.</p>

<p>At the end of the third flight, Bison Billiam
remained silent a long time, evidently the prey
of a heavy discouragement. Suddenly the light
of inspiration sprang to his brow; his voice rang
clear in the glade. "Cut six inches off the left
wing," he cried, "and leave the right as it is.
Shear the left and leave the right as it is!"</p>

<p>Charles-Norton gazed at him open-mouthed.
But by this time there was little left in him
strong enough for rebellion. He closed his mouth
again. Dolly interceded with a glance of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
soft eyes, but Bison Billiam was aglow with his
idea. "Cut!" he cried.</p>

<p>Dolly cut.</p>

<p>This time the result was eminently satisfactory.
With great effort, with cracking sinew
and sweating brow, Charles-Norton managed to
circle the meadow once with heavy, awkward
flapping. His neck was awry with the uneven
pressure, his fine body was twisted; he almost
struck the ground between each stroke, and as
he was passing his audience on the beginning of
a second lap, he lost control suddenly, turned
clear over, and flopped to earth at their feet.</p>

<p>Bison Billiam could not restrain his enthusiasm
now. He clapped his hands, he skipped
about like a child. "Fine; fine!" he cried, and
his deep voice rang clear to the crest; "that's the
stuff; now we've got it! By Jove," he swore,
his satisfaction rising to delirium, "I'll give you
four hundred <i>and fifty</i> a week!"</p>

<p>They left immediately, Charles-Norton dressing,
for the first time in many days, in his city
suit of clothes. The wings, even though&mdash;rectified,
bulged the coat, but this was hidden by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
cape of his mackintosh, which Dolly, providentially,
had brought with her from the city. They
wended their way back along the trail to the
camp, Charles-Norton bronzed like a farmer,
choking in his white collar, Dolly very pretty
in her tailor suit, her furs, and her toque, Bison
Billiam resplendent on his white horse; and before
them Nicodemus trotted demurely, a dress-suit
case in each saddle-bag, another slung atop.
They left him at the camp, grazing philosophically
on his old dump. Charles-Norton gave him
an affectionate farewell slap, Dolly kissed him
on the nose, and they then climbed aboard the
shining private-car which stood ready for them
on the siding. One end of the private-car was
a luxurious stable, in which the white horse
climbed along a cleated gang-way. A half-hour
later the passing Overland train picked up the
car, and slowly clicking along the summit, they
saw, between two snow-sheds, the little meadow,
its lake, and its cabin, pass by, out of their
vision, out of their lives.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton took off his coat, which felt
very tight. A private-car had a freedom, and
comforts, which a public-car has not; a faint
appreciation of this fact came to Charles-Norton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
as he settled back, coatless, in his upholstered
chair, and with it the first vague snuggle of readjustment.
This feeling became clearer after
the dainty breakfast served by Bison Billiam's
white-capped cook, and expressed itself in a sigh
almost of content when Bison Billiam, with the
coffee, passed him a great fat cigar. Charles-Norton
threw a surreptitious glance at the heavy
band; it was a dollar cigar.</p>

<p>Life, after all, has its compensations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<hr />

<p class="cap">And now, how about Charles-Norton and
Dolly?</p>

<p>Well, they are getting along very well;
very well, very well indeed.</p>

<p>Of course, they have their little differences&mdash;as
have most couples. Mostly, it is about wings.
There seems to be a something fundamental
about both Charles-Norton and Dolly which irresistibly
makes them diverge on the question of
the proper length of wings (male wings at least).
For a time, in fact, during the first months of
their intoxicating public success and before they
had arrived to the present adjustment, the question
threatened to bring the conjugal craft to
a final wreck. Strangely enough (or naturally
enough) it is a catastrophe that eased the situation.
One night, after Dolly, in a sudden access
of resentment, had taken an immoderate whack
out of the left wing, Charles-Norton tumbled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the ground in the midst of his performance, and
broke his ankle.</p>

<p>It was, of course, in an agony of remorse that
Dolly nursed her husband during his long month
of enforced and bed-ridden idleness. Luckily,
Bison Billiam behaved beautifully. He let the
salary run on during the whole course of Charles-Norton's
incapacity, and then, with genial inspiration,
prevailed upon him, when he had recovered,
to make his public reappearance with
the heavy plaster-of-paris cast still upon the injured
leg&mdash;which immensely increased the Flying
Wonder's popularity and success.</p>

<p>A <i>modus vivendi</i> was agreed upon after this,
which is still in force and works very well.
Bison Billiam was made the permanent arbitrator
of the wing question. Whenever they have
a little difference now, Charles-Norton and Dolly
go to Bison Billiam, and, standing before him
hand in hand, listen to a sage adjudication of
their rights and their wrongs. They call him
Papa Bison.</p>

<p>And so, they are quite happy. Dolly, of course,
takes a keen pleasure in her home. She has a
neat little brick house, with a white door, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the Riverside Drive, and a butler. A butler always
had been Dolly's secret dream.</p>

<p>Charles-Norton, also, though unconsciously
perhaps, gets a good deal of pleasure out of the
house (and the butler), for Dolly, with innate
genius, has given it an air of quiet elegance and
culture which he secretly enjoys. There is, also,
a certain contentment in living life along a
definite routine. He flies every night but
Sunday, and two afternoons a week. And
then, if Dolly has her house, he has his automobile.</p>

<p>A big, high-powered, red automobile. He goes
out in it with Dolly every Sunday. When he
arrives to a certain point in a certain highway,
where the road is smooth and hard, and undulates
up and down like a Coney Island chute for
many miles, he leans forward and puts his chin
close to the back of the chauffeur, who is French,
and looks like Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>"Let her out," he says.</p>

<p>The chauffeur, with a grin, "lets her out"&mdash;and
they swoop down and up, down and up, in
increasing speed. The road is a ribbon, which
she rolls hungrily within her; the trees, the rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
houses on both sides, coalesce into two solid,
whirling walls.</p>

<p>"Faster," says Charles-Norton.</p>

<p>The world becomes two parallel planes of solid
atmosphere, rushing along close to right and left;
the air strikes their faces like a fist, closing their
nostrils till they gasp; the machine's hum becomes
a cry; its flaps rise like wings.</p>

<p>"Faster," says Charles-Norton.</p>

<p>He seems to leave his body; it wafts off behind
on a current of air, like a hat&mdash;and he is only a
soul, a delicious kernel of soul ecstatically drunk,
floating like an atom through the eternities.</p>

<p>"Faster," he says.</p>

<p>But he is aware now of a shrill, insistent,
strident sound. It drills into his soul; it will
not be quiet; it will not let him be. Bing! His
body, catching up from behind, drops about him
again&mdash;and then he knows. It is Dolly; Dolly
screaming, poor little Dolly hysterical with fear.</p>

<p>"Slow up," he says to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The world gradually changes from a mere
blur of parallel lines to visible groupings of
matter. Trees, houses, the road, the sky reappear
as through a curtain torn before them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>The chauffeur wipes his brow. "Ah, Monsieur!"
he says.</p>

<p>And Dolly, very pale, says with an impatience
that seems weary, as though it were repeating
itself for the thousandth time "Oh, Goosie, why,
why, why will you scare me so?"</p>

<p>Charles-Norton is penitent, but a bit morose.
"Gee," he says; "that wasn't fast. That wasn't
fast." His eyes go off, very far; a vague, vague
yearning, covered over with layer and layer of
resignation, palpitates faintly at the pit of his
being. "You don't know what speeding is," he
murmurs; "you don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The machine, at smooth half-speed, is returning
toward the city. "I won't go with you
again," says Dolly.</p>

<p>But she always does. She doesn't like to ride
fast, and he does, but she never lets him ride
alone. 'Cause she loves him!</p>

<p>He will have to be more careful now, however.
The other evening, as they sat in the cozy reading-room
(lined with editions de luxe) after the
performance, she got upon his knee and, hiding
his eyes with her hands so he could not look at
her, whispered something in his ear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>Charles-Norton sat silent a long moment after
that. Then he said, as though speaking to himself:
"I wonder if <i>he</i> will&mdash;if <i>he</i> will also&mdash;if
<i>he</i> will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder; I wonder!" said Dolly, ecstatically,
her eyes wide upon a splendid vision.</p>

<p>"We could keep them down," said Charles-Norton,
consideringly, "by beginning early. By
beginning early, with bandages, we could keep
them down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>To his great amazement, Dolly dissented.
"Oh, no, no, no, no!" she cried. "Oh, he
would look so cute with them&mdash;just like a little
angel! Just like a little angel, Goosie!"</p>

<p>And Charles-Norton is still wondering about
this differentiation in Dolly's wise little head,
wondering why <i>he</i> can, while Goosie&mdash;can't.<br /><br /><br /></p>
